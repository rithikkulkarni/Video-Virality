From the technical aspects to the overall quality of content, it's been a rollercoaster ride of learning and improvement. I'm genuinely pleased with the results. Your support means the world to me, and I can't wait to continue this journey together.

Arranged by: @JarrodRadnichMusic  
Performed & Interpreted by: @RBMusicPiano 

Hello Everyone!

When I chose ""Don't Stop Believin'"" for my next video, I found myself torn between two impressive arrangements: those by Jarrod Radnich and Gamazda. It was challenging to pick an arrangement as the foundation for my own rendition, but ultimately, Jarrod's arrangement won me over. 

Choosing Jarrod's arrangement as the foundation for my rendition wasn't just a decision; it was a commitment to channeling the essence of his unique style into my performance. Obviously, there are many tweaks which I implemented in order to make it my own, but I still did my best to maintain the powerful tone and emotional depth that Jarrod's arrangement delivers. 

Diving deeper into the arrangement, I must emphasize that my goal isn't to merely replicate Jarrod's music, but to infuse it with my own artistic voice. The process involved numerous tweaks and personal touches, all aimed at creating a rendition that reflects not only the power and grandeur of the original composition but also my own emotional connection to the music.

Maintaining the powerful tone and emotional depth inherent in Radnich's arrangement presented both a challenge and an opportunity for artistic expression. As a pianist, I strive to breathe new life into the piece, offering a fresh perspective while honoring the timeless essence of ""Don't Stop Believin'.""

Hello Everyone!

I am beyond excited to share my first video of 2024 with you, and it's an incredibly special one. Today, I bring you ""Empire of Angels"" by the talented Thomas Bergersen, with the arrangement masterfully created by Patrik Pietschmann. Before we dive into this emotional journey, I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to Patrik for his incredible work, and I give him full credit for the arrangement that has added a new layer of beauty to this composition. However, this composition holds a profound significance in my heart, and I wanted to take a moment to share the emotional journey behind why I chose it for this video.

Exactly one year ago, during this period, I found myself navigating through one of the toughest moments of my life. The challenges seemed insurmountable, and hope felt distant. It was during these dark days that I stumbled upon ""Empire of Angels."" The hauntingly beautiful melody and powerful composition became my refuge, a source of strength that resonated with my struggles. I vividly remember listening to this piece repeatedly, finding solace in its notes, and drawing motivation from its energy. ""Empire of Angels"" became more than just music; it became a guiding light, reminding me that the tough times were temporary, and I could emerge stronger on the other side.

It wasn't until February 2023 that I mustered the strength to take action, and that's when my life began to change for the better. This music, coupled with Patrik’s brilliant arrangement, played a pivotal role in helping me make significant changes, instilling a sense of resilience and determination within me. It might sound unbelievable, but I genuinely attribute a part of my transformation to this remarkable soundtrack.

And then, I had the incredible fortune of meeting a beautiful girl. Her presence brought an added layer of warmth and love to my life, making the journey even more profound. She became my pillar of support, helping me overcome my traumas and heal from the wounds of the past, and, to this day, I could not be more grateful to have her by my side.

Fast forward to February 2024, I've decided to pay tribute to this incredible piece with Patrik's arrangement by mastering it. This video is not just a musical showcase but a celebration of overcoming adversity and finding strength in the most unexpected places.

May this music touch your heart and help you face challenges as much as it has with me, and may it inspire hope and resilience in your own life. Thank you for being a part of this community, and I look forward to sharing more meaningful moments with you.

Hello everyone!

I am very happy to finally be able to publish a new video. This time around, I needed more time as I dedicated many hours to research new ways to improve the quality of my videos. If you notice that the visuals stand out from the rest of my videos, you would be right. In the past month, I changed my setup and equipment, starting from scratch to enhance the overall quality of my videos.

In this video, I'll be sharing the results of those efforts, and I'm excited to showcase the improvements that I've made. Changing my camera and adjusting the overall setup were essential steps in elevating the viewing experience, and I can't wait for you to see the difference.

Now, let's talk about the musical piece. For this video, I decided to build upon Patrik Pietschmann's arrangement of ""How to Train Your Dragon."" It's a fantastic piece, and I've taken the liberty to re-arrange some parts to add my own touch. I hope you enjoy this fresh perspective on a beloved composition.

And before we dive into the music, I want to express my gratitude. We are currently reaching 10k subscribers, and I cannot thank you enough. Your support means the world to me, and I really appreciate each and every one of you who has contributed to our growing community.

Thank you for your patience and ongoing support. I'm constantly striving to bring you the best content possible, and I genuinely appreciate each and every one of you who takes the time to watch, comment, and share my videos. Your encouragement keeps me motivated to continue improving and exploring new creative avenues.

Hello, everyone!

It's been a while since I last uploaded a video, and I'm so happy to finally be back after a four-month hiatus. I've missed this community and creating content for you all. 

For my return, I wanted to share something special with you. This particular soundtrack holds a special place in my heart because ""Spirit"" was a movie that played a significant role in my childhood and the music from it has always resonated with me deeply. It is needless to say that this is  I hope you enjoy my rendition of Patrik's arrangement. 

In this video, I decided to experiment with the sound of strings, which, in my opinion, beautifully accompanies the melody. I've also made some changes to my effects to enhance the overall experience. I'm still in the process of learning and refining these effects, so bear with me as I work towards delivering even greater quality in the future. And by the way, this video happens to be my longest one yet, so there's even more music to enjoy!

Thank you for your patience during my break, your support means a lot to me, and I can't wait to hear your thoughts in the comments!

Piano version based on @PatrikPietschmann 's Titanic arrangement.
Reinterpreted and rearranged by RB Music.

Hello everyone! It has been a while since I published my last video. The reason for this, is because my university studies have been demanding more of my time in these last few weeks. On top of that, I wanted to take the time to do some research and development in order to improve the quality of my videos, in particular the bottom half of my hands. It became noticeable that, in my previous videos, there was a persistent and annoying shadow covering a section of the keyboard. I was fortunately able to fix this and refine my visual effects as well. 

Excuses aside, I am happy to be able to finally publish a piano version of one of the most famous scores of all time: Titanic! This arrangement is based on @PatrikPietschmann 's arrangement and I have to give great credit to him for inspiring me. I find that Patrik's finale is truly a masterpiece, and I think he did a fantastic job at interpreting the original theme of ""My Heart Will Go On"" and giving it power!

However, for this piece, my objective was not just to replicate Patrik's video. I wanted to bring something original as well. In fact, this is NOT just a piano version of ""My Heart Will Go On"". I decided to arrange different scores of James Horner (composer of the all the soundtracks in the movie) and blend them together in order to achieve a full on immersive ""Titanic experience"" for the piano. My own arrangements for this video are based on the following soundtracks:

""The Dream""
""A Building Panic""
""Take Her to Sea Mr. Murdoch""

The docking scene in the movie features one of the most epic and stressful soundtracks I have ever heard and I wanted to try and recreate that feeling on the piano. I hope you enjoy it!

Hello! My name is Richard Burns. I am a 20 year old pianist based in Italy and France and I love making piano videos for you to enjoy. I mostly listen to movie soundtracks and compositions and I use Ableton Live to record my piano performances.
