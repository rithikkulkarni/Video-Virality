As South Africa’s conflicts came to an end, thousands of highly trained soldiers were left without a future in the military. Among them was Eeben Barlow, a former commander in the South African Defense Force. Instead of leaving his skills behind, Barlow saw an opportunity—one that would change the landscape of modern warfare.

In 1989, he founded Executive Outcomes, a private military company that offered highly skilled soldiers to governments in need. Unlike traditional armies, Executive Outcomes was not tied to any country or ideology—it operated purely on contracts and mission success. As conflicts spread across Africa, the company quickly became known for its effectiveness in stabilizing war-torn regions.

But how did Executive Outcomes grow into one of the most influential private military companies of its time? And why did governments around the world take notice?

It’s August 13, 1963, and America was coming out of a recession
People weren’t working, people weren’t confident
So JFK knew he needed to do something to get the people back on their feet, to give them some hope,  some opportunity! And that’s when he announced something BIG: a huge 20% tax cut for everyone, 
Not just for corporate America, not just for the cronies, but a ton of tax cuts for every single American across the board
And so, he stood in front of the nation, saying that this was your time to get rich! This was your chance to get wealthy!
We’re talking hundreds of billions of dollars were made over just the next 4 years,

Whether you like him or not, Trump is handing you this exact same golden opportunity right now 
Lower taxes, less regulation,  
hopefully less government spending
Except this time, with the internet, with the size of the market, with how fast things move, with all the resources at our disposal - the wealth that is gonna be made during this golden age will be unlike anything the world has ever seen…
The question is, will you let this opportunity go to waste while you watch everyone else get rich and prices go up?

Those in power are betting on you not taking action - they’re betting on you settling for your comfortable, but soul-sucking job - so that you keep the economy running, 
That’s why jobs are designed to only pay you just enough to survive, because if they pay you too much - eventually you’ll quit and break free!
That’s why the government needs you to buy a home on a mortgage, a car on an auto loan, a degree on student debt, 
Because when you’re in a constant state of debt, 

Before you know it, this golden opportunity is over, 
They make inflation go exponential because it makes the government’s debt cheaper to pay back,
Just like Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn predicted, 9-5 jobs have become rare, as everyday people have to juggle multiple gig jobs to even survive, with little chance of retirement because this is also exactly when social security will be “depleted” as well
Government debt has really gone exponential, 
So whereas the interest payments on our debt currently make up 20% of our country’s spending,  now it’s at 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% - and what happens then? That’s when the system collapses, that’s when the dollar collapses…
And this isn’t hyperbole…
The British Pound lasted 105 years
The Dutch Guilder, 80 years
The Spanish Real? 110 years
The Portuguese Escudo? 80 years
And guess what? The Dollar has already lost 99% of its value?
It’s only a matter of time before something drastic happens.

So that’s why this time in history is your one shot to make enough money in the next 10-12 months to set you free, so that you can pour that money into assets that will rise in value with all this coming inflation. If you don’t, instead of rising with inflation, you will be crushed by inflation. 
And if you already can’t save up much money working a 9-5 making $40,000 a year, or even $80,000 a year, 
If there’s zero chance of you randomly getting a $1,000,000 raise or bonus at your current job?
Then you need to set up an income stream on the side that has been proven to make money, that isn’t tied to your finite labor, 
If the rich are rich because they only do the thinking, planning, strategizing (the easy part), and then they outsource all the labor to 9-5 workers or cheap overseas workers - and you’re still stuck doing the labor like they conditioned you in school,
Then the income stream you set up also has to be something where you have to do the smart work, and you can outsource the rest.

If traditional investments aren't gonna make a dent
Where even if you put $100,000 into Bitcoin and Bitcoin doubles in price, that's still only another $100,000, that’s not gonna be enough to set you free,
If altcoins are gambling where most people lose their life savings,
Then you gotta spend the next 12 months and onward investing in the one thing that all rich people invest in first: yourself
And once you get those 1000x, 10,000x, 100,000x returns from investing in yourself, then you can pour that money into traditional investments

That’s why in this Part III, we’re gonna take the principles we went over in the last video, and I’m gonna show you what’s happening in the world right now that you can use to ascend from the Middle Class once and for all.
You’re going to learn exactly what needs to be done in order to leverage this golden age, so that you can create the life you’ve always dreamed of.

With Trump in charge, these next 10-12 months will be the easiest time in recent history to make money and build your wealth.
And with 9-5 jobs being replaced by gig workers and cheap workers overseas,
With the Great Melt-Up right around the corner after Trump leaves office as the government debt keeps hockeysticking, 

These next 10-12 months might be your last chance to escape the Middle Class with relative ease, by making as much money as you can, and pouring that money into assets before everything gets more expensive from inflation.
But how?
Well, to make an extraordinary amount of money in a very short amount of time, is gonna require some extraordinary thinking. 
If you think like a worker like they conditioned you in school, it will lead you to take the same actions as a worker, which will then make you get the same outcome as a worker
Which is why this Part II, is so so important.
If you don’t uninstall the years of conditioning they’ve shoved down your throat since pre-school, then no matter how hard you try, you will always be doomed to fail.
They say the most important decision you ever make is the person you decide to marry. I disagree. I think the most important decision you will ever make are the principles you choose to believe in.
The wrong principles like “you need luck to be successful, or that you need money to make money”, will make you give up before you even start, it will make you self-sabotage yourself - it will guarantee you a life of poverty
But the right principles will make winning almost an inevitability.
So let’s go over the principles you need to ascend from the Middle Class before it’s too late
Let your reconditioning commence… 

Throughout our time in the education system, we’ve been conditioned to think that luck is just something some people are born with.
That those people over there? Yeah they just got lucky, but you have to be realistic
And when you watch these founder stories on YouTube, you’ll hear the same thing:
You’ll always hear the founders say “oh I just got lucky”, “I was just at the right time, right place. Nothing to see here…”
When in reality? This answer is complete BS:
These people are either giving a cop-out answer because they don’t truly understand how they got there,
Or they’re lying to come off humble, to make themselves more likable, that “I’m nothing special, I’m just like you! You have no reason to resent me?!”
But was it really luck?
Well think about it this way: if I scrolled into a bad neighborhood wearing a Rolex and I got robbed, was I actually unlucky?
Or did I end up in an unlucky environment where I was a million times more likely to get robbed?
And the same can be said about “getting lucky” enough to escape the Middle Class:

$100,000? $200,000? Maybe even $500,000 at a finance job after many decades? That’s it. 
There’s literally a 0.0% chance of you ever getting “lucky” and getting a $1,000,000 fast, $10,000,000, or $100,000,000
But what are the chances of you getting that in business? The chances are definitely over 0%.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dyua1pNew48/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dyua1pNew48/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dyua1pNew48/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dyua1pNew48/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dyua1pNew48/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Jake Tran,27,none,The next 12 months are your last chance to escape the Middle Class,"🔴 Click HERE to be the first to get access when PART 3 drops! ➡️ https://l.escapethemiddleclass.yt/join



With Trump in charge, these next 10-12 months will be the easiest time in recent history to make money and build your wealth.
And with 9-5 jobs being replaced by gig workers and cheap workers overseas,
With the Great Melt-Up right around the corner after Trump leaves office as the government debt keeps hockeysticking, 

These next 10-12 months might be your last chance to escape the Middle Class with relative ease, by making as much money as you can, and pouring that money into assets before everything gets more expensive from inflation.
But how?
Well, to make an extraordinary amount of money in a very short amount of time, is gonna require some extraordinary thinking. 
If you think like a worker like they conditioned you in school, it will lead you to take the same actions as a worker, which will then make you get the same outcome as a worker
Which is why this Part II, is so so important.
If you don’t uninstall the years of conditioning they’ve shoved down your throat since pre-school, then no matter how hard you try, you will always be doomed to fail.
They say the most important decision you ever make is the person you decide to marry. I disagree. I think the most important decision you will ever make are the principles you choose to believe in.
The wrong principles like “you need luck to be successful, or that you need money to make money”, will make you give up before you even start, it will make you self-sabotage yourself - it will guarantee you a life of poverty
But the right principles will make winning almost an inevitability.
So let’s go over the principles you need to ascend from the Middle Class before it’s too late
Let your reconditioning commence… 

Throughout our time in the education system, we’ve been conditioned to think that luck is just something some people are born with.
That those people over there? Yeah they just got lucky, but you have to be realistic
And when you watch these founder stories on YouTube, you’ll hear the same thing:
You’ll always hear the founders say “oh I just got lucky”, “I was just at the right time, right place. Nothing to see here…”
When in reality? This answer is complete BS:
These people are either giving a cop-out answer because they don’t truly understand how they got there,
Or they’re lying to come off humble, to make themselves more likable, that “I’m nothing special, I’m just like you! You have no reason to resent me?!”
But was it really luck?
Well think about it this way: if I scrolled into a bad neighborhood wearing a Rolex and I got robbed, was I actually unlucky?
Or did I end up in an unlucky environment where I was a million times more likely to get robbed?
And the same can be said about “getting lucky” enough to escape the Middle Class:
And sure, there are people that win the lottery, but time and time and time again, we see them lose it all - because they never developed the skill to keep the money
But when it comes to founders and entrepreneurs that actually started from nothing - was it really just luck?
Or did they just stumbled upon a lucky environment, where they’re a million times more likely to hit it big, did they just stumble upon a different game where it’s even possible to hit it big?
If you work the average 9-5 job, what is the most amount of money you could possibly ever make in a year? 
$100,000? $200,000? Maybe even $500,000 at a finance job after many decades? That’s it. 
There’s literally a 0.0% chance of you ever getting “lucky” and getting a $1,000,000 fast, $10,000,000, or $100,000,000
But what are the chances of you getting that in business? The chances are definitely over 0%.",en,206812,9064,0,815,

So you run a country and you have a problem:
Every few years, you have to get re-elected. 
And what is the #1 way to get fired by voters?
If the economy is doing bad… Because a bad economy equals people struggling to pay rent, buy food, and all that stuff.
Heck even if you run a dictatorship, if the people are suffering too much, eventually you’re gonna get overthrown…
So that’s why your #1 priority as a noble leader is “growth” - economic growth
Why? Because if your country makes more money, there’s less unemployment, the plebs are at least content with the status quo, you get more tax dollars, more weapons, more nukes, more leverage over other countries, and ultimately, more power.
Why do you think all they talk about at the Federal Reserve, on CNBC, on the White House podium is “growth”? 
Why do you think they’re so scared of an “economic slowdown”?
It’s because America is mostly run by a bunch of people who might get fired every few years by voters.
And creating growth lets you keep your power and gain more of it. 
But here’s the thing, the only way you’re gonna get more economic growth, is if you have a giant segment of your population slaving away
What do I mean by that? 
Well just think about what it takes for a giant country like the US to grow at 2% a year: if your economy is gonna grow at 2% a year indefinitely, someone’s gotta pick up the trash? 
Someone’s gotta flip the hamburgers build the roads, construct the buildings, clean the sewers, do the bookkeeping, mop the floors, deliver your food, operate the buses, and a bunch of other tasks that are very vital, but also very miserable to do?
In other words, you need a bunch of people, who no matter how much they hate their lives, no matter how resentful and bitter they are about giving up on their dreams - you need them to still get up every day… and just take it. Take it for the good of the country…
Because if your population doesn’t do that, there’s nothing!
If everyone today who works a miserable job isn’t motivated to wake up tomorrow and do your plumbing, pick up your trash, make sure the street lights are working - everything goes to hell.
In fact, this is the only difference between a 1st world country and a 3rd world country:
Putting aside the corruption we cover on this channel, the only difference between a 1st world country and a 3rd world country is some dude waking up, and deciding to pick up your trash…
The trash man has no real motivation to pick up your trash?
So how do you motivate him?
Well back in the day, you’d motivate people by making them indentured servants: they’d owe you money, so they’d have to work for you to pay it off, or else they’d go to prison!
But those days are over.
And even if you could still get away with that, it’s just not very efficient. If a pleb feels subjugated, they will resent you, they won’t work as hard, they’ll dig their heels into the ground and eventually, it will backfire.
So there lies the multi-trillion dollar question of every nation-state.
How do you convince your population to want to be cogs in the wheel? To feel the need to sacrifice their working lives for the good of the country - without using force?
Simple - you stack the cards against them so much that they feel like they always have to work
You give them just enough freedom to feel free, but not enough to where they’ll actually ever break free…
You pay them just enough so they can live paycheck to paycheck, but not enough to where they’ll ever become financially free…
And when they do manage to save up a meager savings - you convince them to get in debt!
The key here is the perception of free will! Tell someone they have to do something, and they feel bossed around.
But if you set up society in a way where they come to that conclusion themselves, well then, you have an obedient, willing cog in the machine…
And if there’s one thing America has perfected more than any other country, it’s that America has created a well-oiled nation of cogs. But not just any cogs - willing cogs
Willing cogs, where no matter how much they hate their jobs, no matter how much they hate their lives!… They will always get up in the morning, and pick up your trash. They will always shut up and take it.
See the politicians are right! The middle class is the backbone of society!
They’re the ones who do the grunt work.
They’re the ones that fund the bailouts, that fund the wars.
They’re the ones that built America into the greatest superpower the world has ever seen.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uU085DHfAm0/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uU085DHfAm0/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uU085DHfAm0/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uU085DHfAm0/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uU085DHfAm0/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Jake Tran,27,none,The Enslavement of the Middle Class (Documentary),"🔴 PART 2 is OUT NOW!

In this video, Caleb Guilliams from Better Wealth exposes how the wealthy elite create generational wealth and how they pass down their wealth to ensure the family wealth keeps growing generation after generation unfeathered by taxes, the government, etc. This is done through a series of complicated family trusts, life insurance policies (what Caleb calls The And Asset), private family foundations, family offices, etc.

Caleb Guilliams from Better Wealth has dedicated his life to learning how the ultra wealthy do things, and bringing down that knowledge down to everyday people like us. 

Life insurance: 
For the ultra wealthy, life insurance is this insanely powerful tool that they keep under wraps
""Your money safe, it will grow the rest of your life. It will grow tax deferred, you can use your money tax free, it will get passed on tax free. It has a lot of other benefits. And so what the wealthy use it is, they don't use it as a, an investment, they use it as like a safe asset. I call it The And Asset because they're able to get their dollars more than one job. And so they're able to do that while it's protected, while, while it's off the radar screen of, of the IRS because it's not considered income. And that's, that's how a lot of wealthy people use it. And then step number three is usually what they, to, to take the money or to utilize the money.""
""You're not withdrawing your money. What a, what a lot of people do cuz that would be in a lot of cases taxable upon gain. They're borrowing against it or using a third party bank to borrow against their assets. And as a result, if you borrow against it, it's not considered income. So a lot of wealthy people like Elon Musk and all these people, they're, they're borrowing against the equity in their businesses insurance. And when you max fund insurance, that's why a bunch of banks do this. Over 3000 banks today have what's called bank own life insurance.""

What you’re watching right now is the world’s first ever hydrogen fuel-cell semi truck on the road, thanks to a company called Nikola Motors. The only problem is - this video is fake. It was a fraud designed to swindle investors into dumping more money into this “tesla killer” - allegedly.

These regular car companies were under huge pressure from analysts and shareholders to electrify so their stock could see similar gains. GM entered into a strategic manufacturing partnership with Nikola Motors. But as GM would soon find out - Nikola Motors was far from the saving grace they hoped for. 

“I never deceived anyone!” - Nikola Executive Chairman, Trevor Milton. Trevor Milton, the man behind Nikola Motors, has had a sketchy track record to say the least. Tech founders are often criticized for being too ambitious or too optimistic, but according to Hindenburg Research, Trevor took this way too literally.

After Trevor sold his very first business, a security and alarm business, Trevor started a used car sales website that ultimately failed, but it got him into the world of EVs. After dHybrid’s launch, Trevor became the CEO of Swift Transportation. But Trevor abandoned ship and decided to start a new, but not very different, company with his dad, called dHybrid Systems LLC. Two years after starting dHybrid Systems, he sold it to Worthington Industries for $15.9m, giving them almost 80% of the company. 

Nikola Motors started a lot like how all of his other business ideas ended, with a lot of stretching of the truth. They started to duct tape together third-party truck parts in an effort to build their first truck.

-----------------------
If you were a skilled worker in the 19th century, you were probably part of a labor union. Basically, a labor union is an organization workers could join for a fee, and in exchange, they would (in theory) get protection from the union against their employers lowering their wages, firing them for no reason, or from bad working conditions. 

One of the first strikes ever recorded happened in 1768 in New York when workers started protesting against getting their salaries cut. 

Suddenly, everyone saw the power of collective bargaining, and people started demanding things like better salaries and less working hours per day. For skilled workers, unions could perform miracles. 

Employers obviously weren’t exactly happy with these strikes, higher wages, and better working conditions. So to fight back, they needed to find ways to put an end to the strikes.

But as we all know, the only way to fight fire, is with fire! 

Mafia controlled labor unions would soon become one of their most powerful, influential weapons.

When the unions came knocking at the mafia’s door for help, the mobsters saw an opportunity of a lifetime. The two things any good mafioso wants most in his life is money and power, and by joining the unions they could get both. 

The mafia took over so many unions that at one point, La Cosa Nostra had unions in every major city in the US.

Unions gave the mafia a chance to expand, get richer, and spread their influence like never before. At one point, you couldn’t even tell the difference between unions and the mob.

Like all good things, the marriage between the mafia and labor unions eventually had to come to an end. What had seemed like an unbreakable partnership was left in pieces.

You run North Korea. To the people of North Korea, you are their greatest hope and joy. You are their god. But your people are starving. North Korea is not poor. How are you living in luxury if North Korea is apparently so “poor”? The Economics of North Korea.

Like any good dictator, you know your rule is only as good as your peoples’ belief in your goodness and power. You have to control every single little piece of information that goes into their heads.

The goal is for everyone to be like those new animals on the farm, with no idea what life was like before the revolution, before Kim Il-Sung. Sure the first generation might not be too submissive because they know this isn’t set in stone. But once you get to the second generation, the third generation - the reign of the Kims will be all they know - and they really will think you are a god.

To successfully run such a utopia, you need to make sure every member of the population believes your story, and your story of the world outside. Everything in North Korean education is brainwashing.

For most North Koreans, Americans aren’t even human. They’re cold blooded monsters who kill and destroy everything they come across. And to continue your brainwashing you go just a few steps further. You decide everything for them. But that’s not enough. The real control point is keeping people hungry.  

A person who is constantly hungry, the only thing that will be on their mind is where they’ll get their next meal. Contrast that with a well-fed pleb - they’ll have time to think about unproductive things like the meaning of life, the pursuit of happiness, is my dear leader really a God? Things that threaten your power! So it’s very simple - keep. them. hungry. 

As the Supreme Leader of North Korea, you are the world’s foremost example of how a dictator can be the god of the 21st century. Those in the West take freedom for granted. Freedom is hard. Freedom requires responsibility. It requires you to think for yourself, to stand on your own two feet. So to an extent, there’s a part of humanity that naturally wants to be ruled.

The British Pound had dominated the global economy since the early 19th century. Leaders from 44 countries met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to decide how the new global economy would run and what it’s financial bedrock would be. The Conference settled on the US Dollar as the de facto global currency. This meant that the paper money printed by one nation was used everywhere.

After JFK, the US chose a radically different economic path filled with expensive spending. The one nation the world trusted to uphold the entire financial system was drowning in debt. 

Nixon changed the very foundation of the global financial system in a total of 16 seconds. By giving the middle finger to countries wanting their gold back, as a “temporary” measure. 

For the first time in modern history, the world moved from the gold standard, to a global reserve currency not backed by anything at all, just the blind faith that the US dollar was worth something - fiat money. 

OPEC, the cartel of Arabic petroleum exporters, announced an embargo on oil sales to the US and the quadrupling of global oil prices.

Why was this so devastating? Because oil dominated every aspect of Americans’ daily lives. When OPEC exposed this giant weakness in America by restricting their oil supply, the US had to make sure something like this would never happen again. Enter - The Petrodollar

You have so much money coming in that you're gonna have to pay way too much to the tax man. You need a way to avoid taxes. And one of the ways to do that is by starting a “charitable foundation”.

In 2014, the CEO of GoPro, Nicholas Woodman, had just taken the company public and was all of a sudden worth $3 billion. He was giving away $500 million of GoPro stock to charity. Every news channel praised him as  what they called one of America's most generous donors and put him up there with people like Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg. He was gonna have to pay tens of millions of dollars in taxes anyways, so by simply “giving away” $500m worth of stock, he saved himself from that giant tax bill. And if you want to do the same, then it all starts with step #1: starting your charity.

The type of charitable vehicle our friend Woodman used is called a DAF. DAF’s or Donor Advised Funds are basically a charitable savings account used by the rich and powerful, like Mark Zuckerberg, Paul Allen, and the founders of WhatsApp, to control where their money goes and when. So DAFs are basically a charity savings account that is a very powerful tool to influence the world to work in your favor, while maintaining complete anonymity - and saving you taxes.


And now that your charity is set up, it’s time to fund it! Donate To Your Own Charity. Once you’ve funded your charity with your own money, why stop there? Why not get other donors involved so you have even more charitable dollars to play around with?

Donors are the lifeblood of your charity. But at some point in this process, you’re gonna need help running your foundation.

Hire Your Friends and Pay Them A Hefty Salary. Now that you’ve taken care of your friends, you’ve staffed and developed you charity, now it’s time to reap the benefits

Spend your charitable dollars lavishly - for the cause, of course. Whether you donate to political organizations or decide to donate to legit charities you support, your choices are endless

And boom - you got to make good use of your money that would’ve gone to the tax man.

In 2020, who did the money printer of the US, the Federal Reserve, hire to manage their scheme to buy corporate bonds? (Basically, they were bailing out corporations that had too much debt or needed to borrow money)
You guessed it, they went right back to BlackRock.
Even though again, the same corporations BlackRock was helping to bailing out, were the same corporations they owned some of the biggest stakes in

And yet, despite all his considerable power, the general public has practically never heard of Larry Fink
With BlackRock barely coming into the public eye during the recent claims that they’re buying up single-family homes
That’s because Larry is smart - he’s intentionally kept it that way
He’s spent the last 33 years building BlackRock into the biggest asset manager in the world, with over $9 trillion dollars under their management
Today, BlackRock’s clients include the retirement accounts of average everyday people in the form of pension funds, they also have sovereign wealth funds as their clients, other central banks, college endowments, “Fortune 500 companies”, and millions of individual investors

This is BlackRock
What some call ""the most influential financial institution in the world,""
The world's largest shadow bank,
And perhaps… the company that owns the world… 
When Larry Fink was asked by Bloomberg if it’s true that he’s the most powerful man in finance - the man responsible for $9 trillion dollars tried to convince you otherwise - that “I don’t think of myself as powerful”
Is that true? Does BlackRock own the world? Well, it’s a little complicated

As soon as you’ve sucked out all the blood you can from them, as soon as they’re no longer useful to you, as soon as your priorities change, that’s where the switch comes in: the favors suddenly come to a halt, you’re no longer at their beck and call, you turn a cold shoulder, you stop answering their phone calls And that’s exactly what Elon Musk and Tesla is experiencing right now with the Chinese Government.

China is the world’s biggest market for electric vehicles. So it’s not surprising that Tesla saw the chance of dominating the Chinese EV market as a no-brainer. Tesla entering the Chinese market was good for the Chinese government as well. A couple months later, Tesla and the Shanghai government sealed the deal for a Tesla gigafactory able to produce up to half a million EVs a year. And the good times just kept rolling. 

Elon Musk had become the Chinese president’s favorite capitalist. Which raises the question, what did China really want out of it? Tesla did in fact raise the bar for local EV manufacturers like Nio and Xpeng: their tech was getting better, and their sales had been on the rise. All of a sudden, Tesla wasn’t so useful to the Chinese government anymore, their priorities changed.

Tesla quickly started running into problems. Suddenly, Tesla executives were being summoned by China Regulators to “discuss” safety issues in their cars, including reports of random acceleration and battery fires. Tesla really started feeling the change in the government's favor, when some of its cars were banned from military complexes over fears that they could be sending their camera data back to the US government. China dealt another blow to the company, stating that all smart cars would need to store their data in-country. Things just kept getting worse. Local governments started reviewing Tesla ownership among their employees, and then came the last straw. 

After claiming Tesla EVs’ autopilot system could be activated automatically and possibly lead to crashes, Beijing ordered pretty much all of the nearly 300k Tesla cars sold in China to be recalled, and their software upgraded for free to fix the safety issue. Tesla had to apologize. Again. 

Tesla is still doing well overall.

Richard Branson was given an ultimatum. He had been crippled with dyslexia his whole life to where he could barely read by the age of 8 and was completely lost when it came to numbers. So school was a torture. And by high school, he had started his first real business: a magazine for students. Seeing him struggle, his high school headmaster called him in one day and said, you can either leave the school and run the magazine, or stay in school and leave the magazine. Richard Branson became a high school dropout.

Richard Branson was born in London in 1950. He came from a loving, happy family. Even as a kid, Branson had an entrepreneurial spirit. And although he had a natural talent for business, Branson wasn’t great in school because of his dyslexia.

Fast forward to the 60s, and the youth wanted a voice. It’s not surprising that soon after the magazine took off, Branson’s headmaster gave him that ultimatum: leave the school and run the magazine, or stay in school and leave the magazine.

As a way to make money for the magazine, Branson got the idea to sell discounted music records by mail. The business took off, but just 5 months after opening, the tax man came knocking and threw him in jail. 

While running the record store, Branson came across a guitar demo made by a 15 year old musician. Instead of letting that discourage him, he thought “screw it, let’s do it,” and created a record label just like that to record it themselves. The album's success made Richard a millionaire before his 23rd birthday.

24 year old Richard Branson was living the rockstar millionaire life. But Branson wanted to do more. And out of the blue, an insurance lawyer called him and asked Branson to back him on starting a Transatlantic Airline.

When Branson launched Virgin Atlantic, one simply didn’t just “start an airline”. Virgin Atlantic was launched with a single, used airplane leased from Boeing. But Virgin Atlantic’s biggest competitor, British Airways, wasn’t happy with this newcomer on the block. So they launched what the media would call the Dirty Tricks Campaign.

Branding is what Virgin is all about. Richard set out to embody that brand and he did everything he could think of to promote it. Some worked, some went under, but he didn’t stop expanding.

This is Ross Ulbriet, he’s the founder of the Silk Road. The first online marketplace on the darkweb where you could buy and sell anything. The site went so viral that by age 28, Ross was on track to become a billionaire within just two years.


Ross Ulbricht grew up in Austin, Texas in the late 80s and 90s. His father taught Ross how to think through every side of an argument. And his mother gave up her dream of becoming a journalist to bet everything on her golden son becoming successful.

Ross became obsessed with Libertarianism. And at one school debate, Ross argued that drugs - all drugs should be legalized. That not only is it not the government’s right to tell people what they can and can’t put in their bodies, and that legalizing drugs would actually make society safer. Ross won that debate.

Ross seemingly tried everything. He started a video game company, an investment fund, did odd jobs on Craigslist, but nothing was working. But then an idea struck him: an anonymous website where you can buy and sell anything.

And by 2009, the anonymous browser, Tor, was already a thing, and the last missing piece of technology Ross would need was released: Bitcoin

Ross started working on what would become the Silk Road. It was basically the equivalent of building eBay or Amazon on your own, without any knowledge, experience, or funding. But little by little, the site came together. Being that the Silk Road would end up generating him around $80m in fees, this original $17,000 investment would give him a staggering half-a-million-percent ROI.

It’s been around half a year since Ross first started working on the Silk Road, and today, it was finally time for opening day. Ross had essentially done the work of a 12 person startup.

Let’s say you’re a cyber criminal - theoretically, of course. Whatever cyber criminal you are, if you’re not making money right now, you suck. The problem with any type of ill-gotten gains is that if you just straight up use that money to buy a lambo, to buy that mansion eventually people like the IRS, the FBI, the DEA, are gonna come knocking on your door, wondering where you got all this money from? So we need a way to clean this dirty money so that it looks like it came from a legitimate source. 

Back in the early days of crypto, it was the Golden age of money laundering. Today however, it’s a lot harder. Regulators are putting more and more pressure on exchanges. That’s where Over The Counter brokers come in. The OTC works their magic and shuffles the funds around with other client’s money and other OTC’s. And then the OTC goes to an exchange like Binance or Huobi to get your cash.

What is Bitcoin Fog? It’s known as a Bitcoin Mixer, or Crypto Tumbler - and it’s exactly what it sounds like. Think of it like a literal laundry machine for crypto. Bitcoin Fog took in around $336m in Bitcoin over its lifespan, which comes out to around a $5m profit for the owner.

Instead of mixing Bitcoins, you can also get out of public cryptos entirely and exchange it for privacy coins. Like Monero, Zcash, and Grin. Privacy coins are just like any other cryptocurrency, except they provide way more, well, privacy. You should be warned, though, these privacy coins may not be around forever.

The invention of Bitcoin ATMs has also changed the money laundering game. This is great if you’re running any traditional rackets where your profits are still in fiat. You take the dirty money, and simply use any one of the 11,000 unregulated Bitcoin ATMs around the world to turn that cash into clean Bitcoin.

Privacy wallets are responsible for around 12% of all Bitcoin laundering last year - making them the preferred choice among cyber criminals.

This is John McAfee - the eccentric tech millionaire, playboy, suspected murderer, international fugitive, presidential candidate, crypto enthusiast… 
And the same man behind that annoying software called McAfee Antivirus that you probably have installed on your computer right now if you have windows
John has lived a… wild existence
Could he, as a 75 year old man with deteriorating health, not take it anymore? Or did the US government have something to do with it?
This is the ridiculous, bizarre, strange rise & suspicious death… of John McAfee

John David McAfee was born on a US Army base in England in 1945. 
McAfee ended up growing up in Roanoke, Virginia. 
In school, McAfee was hardly the nerd you’d imagine would become one of the biggest tech entrepreneurs of the 20th century.
He admitted although he got straight A’s and did well in math, he was a lazy kid and almost never studied.
Then he got a position as a programmer at Lockheed Martin
And in 1986 as home computers were taking off, two brothers in Pakistan launched the world’s first computer virus nicknamed “Brain” - and McAfee saw an opportunity he couldn’t pass up

1987, McAfee launches McAfee Associates to create his all-in-one antivirus software, called VirusScan. Which was the first of its kind and covered all of the dozen or so computer viruses that existed back then.
The software worked and he decided to make it free for anyone to use
Within the first month of its launch, 4 million people were using it
By 1990, millions of computers were using it and companies were paying over $5m a year to license it
And by 1992, more than half of the Fortune 500 companies had McAfee on their computers
McAfee became a tech icon
He became the leading voice on the threat of computer viruses and by 1992, McAfee Associates IPO’d - making him worth $80 million dollars.
In 1994, McAfee was pushed out of management - so he sold his shares for $100m and left the company
And from there he would spend the next one and a half decades living the life of a tech mogul with more much money than he knew what to do with
He bought multiple cars, built 9 homes, became an adrenaline junkie, then a new\-age yoga guru, then built an adventure sports resort in New Mexico… 
But by 2008, McAfee says he kept getting hit with frivolous lawsuits by people who wanted to take his money

All these temptings with fate happened during cold wars. Which brings us to today, with the biggest cold war the world has ever seen, where the players are bigger and more powerful than ever: the US and China. And the geographical center of this new Cold War? The South China Sea

For us in the West, the South China Sea might sound like just some random body of water over in Asia - what’s the big deal? Well, the South China Sea is to China what the Mediterranean Sea was to the Roman Empire. It is one of the most important bodies of water today. Needless to say, whoever controls the South China Sea, will flourish and dominate Asia.

Dividing up land with borders is pretty easy since we live on land so it’s tangible. This meant that every country had the right to everything within 200 nautical miles of their shores. Any area that doesn’t fall within a country’s EEZ is considered international waters and follows UN maritime laws. This is great and all, but the problem comes when you’re dealing with an area like the South China Sea, where multiple countries are right next to each other so all their EEZ’s overlap. But the country with the biggest take on what’s theirs, is China.

China claims that around 90% of the South China Sea is theirs, even though it only borders less than a quarter of the entire area. Since China obviously owns all of these waters and the other surrounding countries have no right to them at all, this has led to some creative aggression from China that has only gotten worse over the years.

For years, the US Air Force had most of its warplanes in just two locations in the western Pacific: Guam and Japan. To counter these two megabases, China simply built a bunch of missiles aimed that the two bases. But with that combined with China’s growing presence in the South China Sea, the US is fanning out its Air Force across the Pacific in preparation for war with China. It’s safe to say that neither side wants war. But that doesn’t mean war will be avoided.

When you look at the Forbes Billionaires list, almost all the men you see made their money in tech: Jeff Bezos with Amazon, Elon with Tesla, Gates with Microsoft, Zuckerberg with Facebook, Ellison with Oracle, and Page and Brin with Google and then you have a man named Bernard Arnault, at #2 with around $170 billion dollars, trailing right behind Jeff Bezos and in front of Elon Musk, and often trading places with them. 

Bernard made his billions in the world of luxury: everything from fashion, leather goods, jewelry, and high-end spirits. He’s the man behind the parent company that owns some of the biggest names in luxury: Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Hennessy, Tiffany & Co, Tag Heuer, Hublot, Sephora, and many more.

The world is ran by smart people. If you look at the totem pole of society, it’s just smart people on top of smart people trying to convince other people to do what they want them to do. When you’re poor, you are owned by smart people: like your boss. But then, some people are able to make it out of that poor phase into the freedom phase where you’re making around $100k a year or more on your own. At this point, smart people can no longer get at you - but they still really want to because we're naturally power hungry creatures. So in order for smart people to convince successful people to do what they want them to do, you have to lure them in with something else. And that something else is luxury goods.

Bernard grew up as the son of a father that owned a manufacturing/civil engineering company in France. According to Bernard, his mom made two major contributions to his life: one, she made him take piano lessons and two, she had a fascination with the perfume and fashion brand Christian Dior. His father was the one that really gave him a sense of business, and by age 25, he took over the reigns of his dad’s company, with the ambitions to start his own empire.

When you look at the Forbes Billionaires list, almost all the men you see made their money in tech: Jeff Bezos with Amazon, Elon with Tesla, Gates with Microsoft, Zuckerberg with Facebook, Ellison with Oracle, and Page and Brin with Google and then you have a man named Bernard Arnault, at #2 with around $170 billion dollars, trailing right behind Jeff Bezos and in front of Elon Musk, and often trading places with them. 

Bernard made his billions in the world of luxury: everything from fashion, leather goods, jewelry, and high-end spirits. He’s the man behind the parent company that owns some of the biggest names in luxury: Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Hennessy, Tiffany & Co, Tag Heuer, Hublot, Sephora, and many more.

The world is ran by smart people. If you look at the totem pole of society, it’s just smart people on top of smart people trying to convince other people to do what they want them to do. When you’re poor, you are owned by smart people: like your boss. But then, some people are able to make it out of that poor phase into the freedom phase where you’re making around $100k a year or more on your own. At this point, smart people can no longer get at you - but they still really want to because we're naturally power hungry creatures. So in order for smart people to convince successful people to do what they want them to do, you have to lure them in with something else. And that something else is luxury goods.

Bernard grew up as the son of a father that owned a manufacturing/civil engineering company in France. According to Bernard, his mom made two major contributions to his life: one, she made him take piano lessons and two, she had a fascination with the perfume and fashion brand Christian Dior. His father was the one that really gave him a sense of business, and by age 25, he took over the reigns of his dad’s company, with the ambitions to start his own empire.

Floyd Mayweather is set to make an estimated $100,000,000 from his fight with Logan Paul. Cementing his position as one of the highest paid athletes in history. Logan Paul on the other hand is set to make $20,000,000, a fifth of what Mayweather gets.

At its most basic level, you have a boxing match, the Mayweather Paul fight, and each boxing match has a prize money pool that both fighters get a cut of no matter who wins. That prize money is also called the Purse. For the infamous Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao fight back in 2015, that purse was reportedly half a billion dollars. In the case of the Mayweather vs Paul fight, the purse is an estimated $100m. But in this case, Mayweather gets not 60% of that purse, but 80%, or $80m. While Logan Paul only gets to walk away with $20m. Why the uneven split? Simple - it’s because the prize money is made up how many people buy the pay-per-view show, ticket sales, and other broadcasts.

The first rumblings of a Mayweather/Pacquiao fight was way back in 2010. It took 5 whole years of trash talking, going back and forth, negotiating the prize money split, before the fight actually happened in 2015. In the business of boxing, everything leading up to the fight is theatre - both fighters have to do their part in making the fight marketable. Which usually includes a lot of trash talking and drama. So trash talk your way to a giant purse then walk home with $100m right?

As a football star in the NFL, your life is a lot easier. But as a boxer, you are literally your own business. You get paid as an independent contractor per fight, no regular paychecks, you don’t work for any of the boxing event promoters - If you don’t fight you don’t get paid.

Fans want to see the most dangerous, exciting fights. But Floyd realized that it was in his best interests to take on the least riskiest fights. Instead of going up against Pacquiao in his prime, Floyd waited 5 years for him to age a little, get a little worn down, build up more and more hype to increase that prize money. And then he fought a more tamed version of Pacquiao 5 years later and walked away with $100m.

-----------------------
Back in April 2019, the greatest stock trade in the history of the world was completed: MacKenzie Scott bought Amazon stock in 1993 - an entire year before the company was founded and sold in 2019, twenty-six years later for a staggering $35 billion in profit. But instead of buying and selling Amazon stock - it was through marrying Jeff Bezos (without a prenup) - and divorcing Jeff Bezos. 

Then there’s poor ol’ Elon - who didn’t go through just one pricey divorce - but three! The first was with Justine Musk. Elon had to pay at least $4 million dollars in legal and accounting fees, which comes out to $170,000 per month. 

Then came his second marriage with actress Talulah Riley. They divorced in 2012, leaving Riley with $4.2 million dollars. Then they made up, got married again and then divorced again a year later, leaving Riley with a much more respectable $16 million. 

Which brings us to Bill and Melinda Gates. Bill married Melinda on a Hawaiian Island around the same time as Bezos in 1994. Twenty-seven years later in 2021, they file for divorce and are still working out how much of the $130 billion dollar empire Melinda is gonna get. Bill has already given her $2.4 billion dollars worth of shares. 

Before you go calling all women gold diggers, unless you’re divorcing the ultra wealthy, usually neither the groom nor the bride comes out on top. Usually, in America, the real gold diggers that profit off of a divorce - are the divorce lawyers, the judges, the family courts.

Well, what most people don’t realize is that in America, marriage is not just a vow of love, but a financial contract.

You hire a divorce lawyer to protect yourself against your spouse taking your stuff. You pay maybe $600/hr, $700/hr, and maybe even more insane numbers. Why do people pay such high rates? Bc they’re desperate!

As a lawyer, you’re paid hourly, therefore, it’s in your best interest to keep the fighting going bc if your client’s divorce is settled, you lose your income stream.

The lawyers aren’t alone in this industry though, the other major players are the judges. And with great power - comes great opportunities to be bribed.

So if you do get married, maybe don’t follow in the steps of Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk and get a prenup.

-----------------------
Back in April 2019, the greatest stock trade in the history of the world was completed: MacKenzie Scott bought Amazon stock in 1993 - an entire year before the company was founded and sold in 2019, twenty-six years later for a staggering $35 billion in profit. But instead of buying and selling Amazon stock - it was through marrying Jeff Bezos (without a prenup) - and divorcing Jeff Bezos. 

Then there’s poor ol’ Elon - who didn’t go through just one pricey divorce - but three! The first was with Justine Musk. Elon had to pay at least $4 million dollars in legal and accounting fees, which comes out to $170,000 per month. 

Then came his second marriage with actress Talulah Riley. They divorced in 2012, leaving Riley with $4.2 million dollars. Then they made up, got married again and then divorced again a year later, leaving Riley with a much more respectable $16 million. 

Which brings us to Bill and Melinda Gates. Bill married Melinda on a Hawaiian Island around the same time as Bezos in 1994. Twenty-seven years later in 2021, they file for divorce and are still working out how much of the $130 billion dollar empire Melinda is gonna get. Bill has already given her $2.4 billion dollars worth of shares. 

Before you go calling all women gold diggers, unless you’re divorcing the ultra wealthy, usually neither the groom nor the bride comes out on top. Usually, in America, the real gold diggers that profit off of a divorce - are the divorce lawyers, the judges, the family courts.

Well, what most people don’t realize is that in America, marriage is not just a vow of love, but a financial contract.

You hire a divorce lawyer to protect yourself against your spouse taking your stuff. You pay maybe $600/hr, $700/hr, and maybe even more insane numbers. Why do people pay such high rates? Bc they’re desperate!

As a lawyer, you’re paid hourly, therefore, it’s in your best interest to keep the fighting going bc if your client’s divorce is settled, you lose your income stream.

The lawyers aren’t alone in this industry though, the other major players are the judges. And with great power - comes great opportunities to be bribed.

So if you do get married, maybe don’t follow in the steps of Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk and get a prenup.

What do you do when you go from making north of $5,000 per scene, or $60,000 per month if you do just 3 scenes a week to a plebian $200 to maybe a thousand dollars a scene, where to even make a measly $30,000 a year

A platform called OnlyFans became a thing - which turned the industry completely upside down, cutting out almost all the middlemen, and putting the profits back in the hands of providers

This is the booming, genius, nutty economics of OnlyFans - a truly disruptive platform that merged the creator economy, with the you-know-what economy.

Instagram, along with YouTube, did something special that the world has never seen before. It allowed average everyday people to create a personal connection with their followers. To the point where you kinda feel like you’re “virtual friends” with your favorite YouTubers and Instagram influencers. OnlyFans was created as a natural bolt-on to Instagram’s free feed, as a subscription-only feed.

If standard YouTubers and Instagram influencers are kinda like your virtual friends, then you can think of OnlyFans models as kinda like your “virtual girlfriends”.

You’re a billionaire. The problem with being a billionaire is that you make a lot of money that you don’t want the government to get their grubby little hands on. So we need a way to hide your wealth discreetly, to reduce your tax burden. 

Buying the art. The fine art world is a very exclusive circle that is made up of only a few exquisite galleries or dealers where art gets sold for the first time, and two major auction houses where art gets resold for increasingly higher prices.

So you go to the gallery of your choice, pick a piece, they don’t put the price on display so you’re gonna have to ask, and when you finalize on a price, it’s then time for step #2 where are you gonna store the art.

Storing the Art. Now, there’s two kinds of ultra wealthy that buy fine art: One are the people that genuinely enjoy art and then there are the ones that purely see art as we called it - a financial instrument to grow their money and get the government’s grubby hands off their wealth. If you really don’t care what the artwork looks like, what you can do is purchase the artwork, and have it shipped directly to what's called a “freeport” which are giant warehouses that you can think of as the physical equivalent of a Swiss bank account.

Pump up those numbers. Art is like any other asset like real estate or stocks. If you own a painting of one artist and other pieces from that artist keep selling for higher and higher prices, the value of your painting goes up too - at least on paper. And this is where the gallery and dealers will do most of the work. Since the most prestigious galleries get the artists they choose to work exclusively through them, they can do some pretty cool tricks to up the value of their art, and thus upping their commission. 

Donate. Let’s say you bought a painting for $10,000,000 a few years back. And today, it’s now worth a nice $50M. So you put $10m into this financial instrument, now you have $50m on paper, and you have that disgusting $37m tax bill staring at you in the face. What you can do is donate that painting to a museum. And then, write off that $50m donation to reduce your $100m of taxable income.

If you own a painting of one artist and other pieces from that artist keep selling for higher and higher prices, the value of your painting goes up too - at least on paper. And this is where the gallery and dealers will do most of the work. 

Donate. Let’s say you bought a painting for $10,000,000 a few years back. And today, it’s now worth a nice $50M. So you put $10m into this financial instrument, now you have $50m on paper, and you have that disgusting $37m tax bill staring at you in the face.

You’re a billionaire. The problem with being a billionaire is that you make a lot of money that you don’t want the government to get their grubby little hands on. So we need a way to hide your wealth discreetly, to reduce your tax burden. 

Buying the art. The fine art world is a very exclusive circle that is made up of only a few exquisite galleries or dealers where art gets sold for the first time, and two major auction houses where art gets resold for increasingly higher prices.

So you go to the gallery of your choice, pick a piece, they don’t put the price on display so you’re gonna have to ask, and when you finalize on a price, it’s then time for step #2 where are you gonna store the art.

Storing the Art. Now, there’s two kinds of ultra wealthy that buy fine art: One are the people that genuinely enjoy art and then there are the ones that purely see art as we called it - a financial instrument to grow their money and get the government’s grubby hands off their wealth. If you really don’t care what the artwork looks like, what you can do is purchase the artwork, and have it shipped directly to what's called a “freeport” which are giant warehouses that you can think of as the physical equivalent of a Swiss bank account.

Pump up those numbers. Art is like any other asset like real estate or stocks. If you own a painting of one artist and other pieces from that artist keep selling for higher and higher prices, the value of your painting goes up too - at least on paper. And this is where the gallery and dealers will do most of the work. 

Donate. Let’s say you bought a painting for $10,000,000 a few years back. And today, it’s now worth a nice $50M. So you put $10m into this financial instrument, now you have $50m on paper, and you have that disgusting $37m tax bill staring at you in the face.

Money - we spend our existence chasing it in the modern world. Yet hardly any of us knows how it works, how the idea of money has changed over time and how we’re on the precipice of the next evolution of money. An evolution that’s either going to be really dystopian, or one that might set us free. And the main player fighting for a more dystopian financial future? China.

During the Tang Dynasty, China invented the next evolution of money. Traders started leaving those strings of coins behind to a trustworthy agent. That trustworthy agent would then record how much money the trader deposited on a piece of paper, the trader would hang on to that piece of paper, to use in place of physical coins. That piece of paper would be known as receipt money. And today, that trustworthy agent can be not-so-trustworthy - and goes by the name of a banker.

Today - it’s also China who’s pushing for the next evolution of money.

Alibaba and Jack Ma launch Alipay, a mobile wallet app that lets users pay for almost anything with a QR code on their phone. Bitcoin is invented. China paid attention. WeChat, China’s messaging app that is used for almost everything, launched its own mobile wallet, WeChat Pay

Facebook announces that it’s going to launch its own cryptocurrency, Libra, that it’s 2 billion users at the time could use to transact on the platform. While the US focused their efforts on stopping Facebook’s power grab - China accelerated their’s.

Although the Chinese government does have ultimate control over these tech giants and they have to send their data to the gov, it’s still a black box, the data is still delayed, the data is still in the hands of powerful people that the gov might not be able to trust, and these tech giants were starting to take over many functions of the traditional banking system and even the gov.

Since the start of the initial Digital Yuan trials, more than 100,000 people have downloaded the government’s mobile app. Basically, China took all the good stuff about cryptocurrencies.

But here’s one thing I’ve learned from Peter Theil, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal, it’s that if everyone is on the same side of an issue, whether that be Silicon Valley all leaning left, or that Blackwater is bad, there’s probably a compelling argument on the other side that gets drowned out.

Around the world, there are over 10,000,000 people held in prison. With the leader in the Prison Industrial Complex being none other than the United States. Yes, the land of the free, home of the brave has not only the highest number of prisoners, but also the most prisoners per capita. 

But what’s the point of having all these people held in captivity that you have to feed, manage, and somewhat provide for? Simple - almost all the parties involved make money.

This is the prison industrial complex.

If you want to be a prison entrepreneur, the business model of private prisons is very simple. Private companies pitched to the government that if you contract the work to us, we can build the prisons you need faster, make them safer, at a lower cost. So today, the job of the prison entrepreneur is to secure government contracts to build and run prisons.

So if you want to make more money, all you have to do is either increase the price of each prisoner per day, lower your operating costs or increase the number of customers in your facilities. 

Let’s say you’re running a company that needs simple manual labor. On one hand, you could hire a normal free citizen but then you have to pay them market wages, maybe offer benefits, 401k’s, deal with labor unions and it’s just a pain. Enter - prison labor! They’re domestic, you pay them pennies on the dollar, and they can’t complain! 

And this is what happens when all these different parties come together: Police, prosecutors, public prisons, private prisons, government contractors, companies that hire prison labor.
But to be fair, some prisons are a lot better than others in how much they cost and how they treat their customers.

A giant container ship named the Ever Given left the port of Ningbo, China, which is just south of Shanghai. The Ever Given flies under the flag of Panama, but it’s owned by the Evergreen Marine Corporation, a huge taiwanese container transportation and shipping company.

The Ever Given would go down the Asian continent. From there, it would start its 10 day journey out at sea all the way to the Gulf of Aden at the horn of Africa, up the Red Sea, all the way to the Suez Port at the south end of the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal is the connecting link between two giant economies: Europe and Asia, that allows ships to not have to sail all the way around Africa, which can add two weeks to the trip.

But in the span of 7 minutes, one of the most important trade routes is shut down, 12% of global trade grinds to a halt, at the cost of $400 million dollars every. Hour.

Initially, they estimated that it would take around a week to get the ship out, but that estimation quickly grew to a few weeks. So the natural question is -what made the ship crash? At first, the crash was blamed on the bad weather. People also started to say that there was a power outage on the ship. The balance of the world can flip within minutes.

Shipping used to be very complicated and expensive. But by the 1970’s - the 20 foot shipping container became the standard. And from that point on, the world economy was forever changed. Or in other words, shipping containers have become part of the lifeblood of the modern economy. 

Since the Suez Canal mainly connects Europe and Asia, initially, there were a lot of fears that it would disrupt the global economy and supply chain. But what you should worry about is just how fragile our delicate world really is.

Since the start of the industrial revolution, everything in society has only gotten more concentrated, more centralized. Which leads us to today, where we’ve optimized everything to be the lowest cost possible, but at the expense of any robustness in our global economy.

The President of Sri Lanka started pushing to build a new port in a small town at the south end of Sri Lanka because ambitious projects like this make you look like a good, caring politician. The only problem was that everyone, including their own government studies estimated that the port wouldn’t be profitable. But then the President announced that the project had been greenlighted - with help from none other than China.

The port opened in 2012, and the forecasts were right - no one was interested in using this new port. And it’s finances were in the hole. So the President went back to China for another loan, this time for $757 million.

So what did they do? They took out another loan from China, this time for $1 billion dollars, to help pay off that upcoming debt payment. It’s safe to say that Sri Lanka found itself at the mercy of the Chinese government. It was drowning in debt payments and was left with an expensive port no one wanted to use. And now, China owns 85% of that port and managed to squeeze 15,000 acres of land around that port as well.

Debt traps, debt diplomacy is nothing new. China is probably just taking a page out of the original master at this game: the US. Why did the US go through all this effort to indebt these Less-Developed Countries, or LDCs? Simple: when you’re a global superpower, you need a lot of resources to stay on top: oil, energy, raw materials, nations under your influence so you can call them up when you need something like votes at the UN, and so on.

Today, China is in a similar position - they’re desperate for energy, money, and resources to continue their astronomical growth to the top.

Who knows in the long run what will happen with China's colonialism. China has the ability to be forceful when needed, especially in their sphere.

Today, China is in a similar position - they’re desperate for energy, money, and resources to continue their astronomical growth to the top.

Who knows in the long run what will happen with China's colonialism. China has the ability to be forceful when needed, especially in their sphere.

A mysterious Louisiana investor completed one of the biggest land sales in recent memory. When you look at farmland sales, you’re typically talking about 100’s of acres. But thousands of acres? Those are blue-moon events made by very big buyers. It had it be someone as big if not bigger than a billion dollar insurance company.

O’Keefe dug deeper and forwarded his findings to his Land Report 100 Research Team. A few minutes later, he gets this response: “Ever hear of Bill Gates?”

O’Keefe’s team followed the paper trail up the chain: That LLC is associated with the Angelina Agriculture Co is controlled by Cascade Investment, L.L.C. Cascade Investment, L.L.C. is what’s called a “family office” located in Kirkland, Washington that goes by the name Bill and Melinda Gates Investments, or BMGI. 

Michael Larson is the chief investment officer for the Gates Foundation. Larson was headhunted to work for Bill Gates in 1994. And after the 2008 financial crisis, the farmland empire began: Larson swooped up “at least 100,000 acres of farmland” all over the country in places like California, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, and more, on behalf of Gates. By 2017, the Agriculture Company of America sold half-a-billion-dollars worth of farmland. And the buyer? The paper trail led right back to none other than Cascade Investment. Which is definitely not outside the realm of possibility - buuut that’s probably not the truth.

After Bill bought nearly 25,000 acres of land west of Phoenix, Arizona - the media was quick to pick up the rumor that Bill Gates was planning on building “the city of the future”. So it’s understandable that when news broke of Bill’s farmland gains, the media was quick to call Bill the “Sustainable Agriculture Champion”. But like most things, reality is oftentimes a lot less glamorous than the theories.

Gates and his money manager, Larson, have a very simple relationship. Larson grows the money, and Gates gives it away.

The Trillion Dollar Flash Crash. Greece was drowning in debt and was on the verge of defaulting on that debt, and going bankrupt. The Greek Parliament announced massively unpopular austerity measures. The Greek Parliament approved these nasty austerity measures in exchange for a $140 billion dollar bailout by the European Union and International Monetary Fund. 

There’s a ton of trading activity in the US stock market. Volatility in the stock market was so high that the New York Stock Exchange had to force trading to slow down. A stock trader grew sick of these high frequency trading firms that have grown to dominate the market over the years. Navinder Sarao decided this would be the day he would go up against them head on and he started “spoofing” the market. He flooded the market with a bunch of sell orders, to trigger those algorithms from the high frequency trading firms causing them to sell, their selling would trigger more selling from other firms, crashing the market. 

Bloomberg releases this alert. Good news - if you saw that and you thought, hmm, I should buy some HP stock bc it’s probably gonna go up. You’d be correct - but you’d be too late bc this is what happened in the next four seconds of the alert going out. The HFT algorithms do what’s called Sentiment Analysis. You can bet that HFT firms are doing this right now in places like Wall Street Bets and Stocktwits

Let’s say you want to buy GameStop at $10 to keep things simple. However, if I’m a HFT and I want to make money off of your order, all I have to do is get your order before all the other sellers see it. I know you’re looking to buy at $10, so I go to the other sellers who haven’t seen that there’s another buyer at $10 bc I’m faster than you, and I buy from them at $9.99, a cheaper price, and then come back to you and sell it for $10. Imagine the profits bigger firms are raking in.

-----------------------
In 1927, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates from 4% to 3.5%. When interest rates go lower, it becomes easier for people and businesses to borrow money. When you spend money, someone else earns more money. The people you spend your money on also get richer. And the richer that person gets, the easier it is for him to get a bigger loan. And this process continues throughout the entire country until the whole economy is booming.

By 1928, the Fed was finally starting to see how troubling all this speculative debt was, so they raised interest rates from the 3.5% that set this bubble in motion, to 5%.

March 1929: the Fed daily secret meetings, but didn’t tell the public what the meetings were about. Fed raises rates again from 5% to 6%. And just like how the Fed lowering rates made people borrow more which cascaded into the market soaring - the Fed raising rates had the opposite effect. October 19, 1929: The Stock Market Crashes.

By New Year’s Day of 1930, the stock market crashed around 50%. Banks started failing left and right, with nearly a thousand banks failing in 1930 alone.

1931: Six million people are out of a job in the US.That cycle downward continues, and as money and credit contracts, the economy starts to really fall off a cliff.

1932: Congress passes the 1932 Banking Act, allowing the Federal Reserve to “print money” - 75 years later we would call this “quantitative easing” - along with even more powers.

After the housing market crash of 2008, the Fed lowered interest rates down to near 0%. Because just like how the Fed lowering rates in the early 1920’s allowed people to borrow more, and spend more, which made incomes go up and the overall economy spiral up. 

By the start of 2020, the market was reaching a boiling point after 131 months of expansion. And then boom - the market crashes by 25%.

-----------------------
In 1927, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates from 4% to 3.5%. When interest rates go lower, it becomes easier for people and businesses to borrow money. When you spend money, someone else earns more money. The people you spend your money on also get richer. And the richer that person gets, the easier it is for him to get a bigger loan. And this process continues throughout the entire country until the whole economy is booming.

By 1928, the Fed was finally starting to see how troubling all this speculative debt was, so they raised interest rates from the 3.5% that set this bubble in motion, to 5%.

March 1929: the Fed daily secret meetings, but didn’t tell the public what the meetings were about. Fed raises rates again from 5% to 6%. And just like how the Fed lowering rates made people borrow more which cascaded into the market soaring - the Fed raising rates had the opposite effect. October 19, 1929: The Stock Market Crashes.

By New Year’s Day of 1930, the stock market crashed around 50%. Banks started failing left and right, with nearly a thousand banks failing in 1930 alone.

1931: Six million people are out of a job in the US.That cycle downward continues, and as money and credit contracts, the economy starts to really fall off a cliff.

1932: Congress passes the 1932 Banking Act, allowing the Federal Reserve to “print money” - 75 years later we would call this “quantitative easing” - along with even more powers.

After the housing market crash of 2008, the Fed lowered interest rates down to near 0%. Because just like how the Fed lowering rates in the early 1920’s allowed people to borrow more, and spend more, which made incomes go up and the overall economy spiral up. 

By the start of 2020, the market was reaching a boiling point after 131 months of expansion. And then boom - the market crashes by 25%.

Long-Term Capital Management was a very non conspicuous name for the biggest hedge fund during the 1990’s. September 1998, LTCM was out of options, everyone on Wall Street thought if they fell, the entire system would collapse. The hedge fund managers collected their sweet fees and profits this entire time, and when it came time to pay, they left the bag for the other banks to hold.

Steve Cohen runs Point72 Asset Management. His name may sound familiar after the whole Gamestop mania. He walked away from one of the biggest insider trading scandals on Wall Street: In 2013, his original hedge fund, S.A.C. Capital Advisors plead guilty to insider trading

Gabriel Plotkin was one of the traders who received insider information. After S.A.C Capital pled guilty to insider trading and closed shop, Gabriel Plotkin would go on to create Melvin Capital, raising $1 billion, with a focus on short selling! After the Gamestop Short Squeeze, Melvin Capital lost 53%.

Ken Griffin founded Citadel, an American multinational hedge fund, the world’s 9th largest hedge fund with over $34 billion under management and Citadel Securities, which is what’s called a Market Maker. During the first half of 2020 alone, they doubled their profits to $4 billion in revenue thanks to increased trading and volatility. This makes Ken Griffin a powerful billionaire in the world of high finance.

When you imagine a young, hyper successful, shark of an American Hedge Fund Billionaire - that’s Chase Coleman. He was born into New York aristocracy and trained under a legendary hedge fund billionaire, Julian Robertson. At 25, his mentor handed him $25 million to start his own fund, Tiger Global Management.

George Soros became known as the man who broke the Bank of England and made a billion dollars in the process. In 1992, Soros started building his position against the British pound by borrowing pounds from British banks and hedge funds.

You know Jim Cramer? He used to be a hedge fund manager that was an expert at these dirty tactics, especially with short selling.  He used to be a hedge fund manager that was an expert at these dirty tactics, especially with short selling.

The ultimate documentary timeline on the Gamestop stock situation.

Hedge funds are like the apexes of Wall Street and the stock market.

Jaime Rogozinski got bored of the idea of “safe” investing, he found existing online forums to be too “risk averse,” and couldn’t stand hearing another word about the “fundamentals” of a company. So he launched a new subreddit, one called “WallStreetBets”

A new startup was founded in Silicon Valley: a baby named Robinhood. At first, it was just an app that allowed you to track stocks, no buying or selling.

GameStop (GME) releases a poor earnings report, cancels dividend payments to people who own the stock, analysts downgrade the stock

Micheal Burry, the investor that shorted the housing bubble and was portrayed by Steve Carell in The Big Short, announces that he owns 3% of GameStop. Micheal Burry and Reddit user DFV, started this whole trend based on fundamental analysis

Robinhood launches a new feature that lets you buy fractional shares.

GameStop $GME hits a low of $2.57.

The billionaire founder of the successful pet ecommerce company, Chewy.com, buys a 9% stake in GameStop.

A member of Wall Street Bets writes a stock analysis on why GameStop could be a winner. GameStop was the most shorted stock on the stock market at the time: with around 120% of their stocks shorted
Since so many people were shorting GME stock, this Reddit user theorized that once the market realizes that Gamestop is not all that bad and more good news comes out, the price will rise, forcing the short sellers to exit their positions, which will drive the price higher, which will cause a short squeeze

Ryan Cohen and GameStop reach an agreement on the board of directors. Because they have so much experience in eCommerce, Ryan Cohen is viewed as the savior of GameStop.

Institutional investors and hedge funds that thought GameStop was for sure going to perish, shorting the stock, pushing it downward
And there were up against the degenerates on Wall Street Bets buying the stock and buying call options for the stock - pushing it upward

Other meme stocks roar like AMC stock. The Reddit traders recruit some unlikely allies: quant funds and other hedge funds that saw an opportunity to get on the right side of the battle

Melvin Capital gets bailed out.

This is Cathie Wood - she runs Ark Invest, a Wall Street firm that invests people’s money into disruptive fields like AI, robotics, gene editing, and more - with over $50 billion dollars under her management. Is Cathie Wood the next Warren Buffet of disruptive tech or just lucky?

Cathie’s career started with a degree in Finance and Economics  in 1981. She started as an Assistant Economist, then spent the next 40 years climbing the ranks of high finance, eventually managing over $5 billion dollars in assets as the Chief Investment Officer at AllianceBernstein. 

In 2014, she registered the ARK Investment Management LLC with the SEC.

Cathie and ARK’s entire investing strategy centers around throwing money into what she calls Innovation Platforms with three things: 1. Costs start high but as more of the product is produced, the price goes down until it reaches a point of critical mass. 2. These Innovation Platforms cut across the economy, different sectors, and spread across the world, like electricity. And 3. They end up helping people create even more innovation.

Cathie argues that this era is going to be the biggest, fastest period of growth humanity has ever seen.

Her company’s popular products are their actively managed ETFs. The ETFs they currently have are the ARK Innovation ETF, Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF, Next Generation Internet ETF, Genomic Revolution ETF, the Fintech Innovation ETF, and soon, a space exploration ETF. She’s expecting to have low 20% returns for the next few years and an entire doubling over the next 5 years.

It’s one thing to open up a hedge fund or a VC firm and offer rich people access to private investments that they wouldn’t normally be able to invest in. 

The Innovation Fund Business Model. Step 1: you want to inspire people by tapping into that religious, sacred aspect of their psychology. Step 2: Invest in overhyped companies that anyone else can buy so you kinda just ride the wave. Step 3: Collect huge fees compared to other passively managed ETFs.  This is nothing new, and it’s kinda like what Wall Street was doing during the dotcom and telecom bubble of the 90’s.

Coming straight from the Federal Reserve, we started this period with around 4 trillion US Dollars in the system. One year later, that number is at 6.7 trillion dollars. Meaning that over 40% of all US dollars were printed in just the last 12 months. And from the looks of it, no one seems to be in a rush to slow things down. And strangely enough, we haven’t seen much inflation for everyday goods like gas and food? Prices definitely haven’t gone up anywhere near 40%?. Where’s the inflation?

The reason why we haven’t seen inflation is because the amount of money being printed is only one of the factors that contributes to inflation
To get inflation, here’s everything you need:
1. Industrial Output: how much “stuff” an economy makes
2. Employment
Too much employment leads to employers fighting over workers, which leads to higher wages, which leads to higher prices
3. The Money Supply: the main topic of this video and probably the easiest to understand
More money when an economy is producing the same amount or less stuff equals higher prices
And 4. If money is exchanging hands, and if so, how fast is it exchanging hands, or the Velocity of Money

And in our case right now, the money supply has shot up a ridiculous amount, but the other factors have been keeping inflation down
Industrial Output: It’s been down from businesses not being able to operate, which means less stuff. But there’s also less demand from you and I to buy those things.
Employment has also definitely taken a hit. And with less employment comes lower wages, which means lower prices. Not inflation.
And the Velocity of Money. It’s pretty slow for everyone with all the uncertainty in the air. People don’t want to spend a lot of money right now if they don’t know if they’re gonna be able to find a job or keep their job
But you know what they are gonna spend it on? The things that only go up! Like Tesla stock, every other stock, real estate, and Bitcoin!
But instead of calling it inflation, we call it the stock market rally,

Only two things happen to chinese billionaires: jail or... December 10th 2015 - Guo Guangchang, AKA as the Warren Buffet of China, disappears. Guo founded the Fosun Group, a mega conglomerate and investment company with over $100 billion in assets. He is the 17th richest man in China in 2015. And yet, on December 10th, 2015, Fosun executives reported that they lost contact with their boss.

January 7th, 2016, almost a month after Guo’s disappearance sent shockwaves through the Chinese business community - Zhou Chengjian, billionaire fashion entrepreneur also disappears. Zhou founded one of China’s best known fashion brands, Meters/bonwe making him the 62nd richest man in China in 2015. And yet, on January 7th, 2016, the company said that they were unable to reach him or the secretary of the board.

January, 2017 - billionaire financier, Xiao Jianhua, who has ties to the Xi Jingping family, gets rolled away in a wheelchair with his head covered by “Chinese public security agents - he was not known to use a wheelchair. Xiao controls the Tomorrow Group, a holdings company with interests in insurance companies, banks, and real estate developers. At the time, he had a net worth of $6b. Later, Xiao called his family to tell them he was taken to the Mainland but that he was fine.

March, 2020 - real estate mogul, Ren Zhiqiang [chi chiang] posted a brutal essay online hating on the great leader and the Chinese Communist Party’s handling of the virus. So starting on March 12th, Ren was understandably never heard from again. And his Weibo account, which had 37 million followers - is now deleted.

October 24th, 2020 - Jack Ma delivers a speech at the Bund Finance Summit in Shanghai. Since then, he’s nowhere to be found. With the only clue to his whereabouts being a three paragraph article from CNBC stating that “the billionaire is not missing. Instead, Ma has been lying low for the time being”

So the question remains - why do Chinese billionaires keep disappearing?

If you’re an aspiring entrepreneur in China, why would you want to start a business if you know that they can take away everything in a moment's notice, and make you disappear? What is the motivation?

-----------------------
Only two things happen to chinese billionaires: jail or... December 10th 2015 - Guo Guangchang, AKA as the Warren Buffet of China, disappears. Guo founded the Fosun Group, a mega conglomerate and investment company with over $100 billion in assets. He is the 17th richest man in China in 2015. And yet, on December 10th, 2015, Fosun executives reported that they lost contact with their boss.

January 7th, 2016, almost a month after Guo’s disappearance sent shockwaves through the Chinese business community - Zhou Chengjian, billionaire fashion entrepreneur also disappears. Zhou founded one of China’s best known fashion brands, Meters/bonwe making him the 62nd richest man in China in 2015. And yet, on January 7th, 2016, the company said that they were unable to reach him or the secretary of the board.

January, 2017 - billionaire financier, Xiao Jianhua, who has ties to the Xi Jingping family, gets rolled away in a wheelchair with his head covered by “Chinese public security agents - he was not known to use a wheelchair. Xiao controls the Tomorrow Group, a holdings company with interests in insurance companies, banks, and real estate developers. At the time, he had a net worth of $6b. Later, Xiao called his family to tell them he was taken to the Mainland but that he was fine.

March, 2020 - real estate mogul, Ren Zhiqiang [chi chiang] posted a brutal essay online hating on the great leader and the Chinese Communist Party’s handling of the virus. So starting on March 12th, Ren was understandably never heard from again. And his Weibo account, which had 37 million followers - is now deleted.

October 24th, 2020 - Jack Ma delivers a speech at the Bund Finance Summit in Shanghai. Since then, he’s nowhere to be found. With the only clue to his whereabouts being a three paragraph article from CNBC stating that “the billionaire is not missing. Instead, Ma has been lying low for the time being”

So the question remains - why do Chinese billionaires keep disappearing?

If you’re an aspiring entrepreneur in China, why would you want to start a business if you know that they can take away everything in a moment's notice, and make you disappear? What is the motivation?

-----------------------
Back in the gold rush days of the mid 1800’s, there was a desperate need to deliver stuff from the East Coast where everything was established, to the new Wild West colonies over in California.

Today, our delivery ecosystem looks a little different. What’s a quantum of delivery that’s smaller than a car and bike, but greater than your feet? And faster and potentially cheaper than both? Drones. Which has led to one of the next great races in engineering. Here’s everything you need to know - and to profit from - the great drone wars.

Imagine a day when with a few taps on your phone, you order a burger. But instead of some pleb delivering it to your door by “car”, the restaurant places your food on a drone where it flies over to you in a relatively straight line (way faster than driving through traffic). That is the dream of delivery drones. Recently with the FAA’s new ruling, starting early 2021, companies will be able to operate their drones around people and at night with some regulations.

If you can be the first company to make a viable drone delivery system, not only are you gonna have the fastest delivery, but your company is going to get the most press, the most word of mouth, the most hype. But perhaps most importantly, the first movers to get this tech working are going to have a massive head start to scoop up market share, and cement their throne at the top of the hill.

Amazon already has their Prime Air program where they’re promising small deliveries in 30 minutes or less via their new drone. UPS partnered with CVS and a hospital to target the healthcare industry and have the drone deploy from the top of their delivery trucks to deliver medicine. Alphabet has their own drone startup called Wing. Wing offers them a way to deliver small goods to their local customers exactly when they need it within 6 miles in 6 minutes. Valqari is offering a solution to the last step in the drone delivery process: where the drone is going to land and take off from, and how to secure the packages for the right person.

Electric airplanes haven’t taken off because of one simple limitation - battery capacity. Drones run into a similar problem but to a lesser degree. 

Now, the naysayers will always mock new ideas like these as “unrealistic” that “this could never happen” that “there are starving children in Africa and you greedy bastards want even faster delivery? Don’t we have a social responsibility to take care of the needy first?” Time will tell.

When you think about a ponzi scheme, you typically think of Bernie Madoff.  The thought of Silicon Valley being a giant ponzi scheme never really crosses your mind. And that’s perhaps exactly why Silicon Valley has grown to be perhaps one of the biggest ponzi schemes in human history.

It all starts with an idea, a new app, a new platform. A disruptive idea that will for sure turn this industry upside down. So the founder manages to get the startup going but they run into a problem. Their revolutionary idea needs a lot more up-front capital to get to the next stage. Luckily, that’s where the Venture Capital firms, or VC’s for short come in.

You come in and say “we wanna partner with you, you’re awesome, we backed this company”. You are what amounts to a fund manager who knows a lot of rich people. In exchange for a fee, Investors hand the VC firm money to be locked up in a fund for 10 years or more. So, if you raise a $100m fund, you’re guaranteed to make a minimum of $17m.

Grow super fast. The founders take the millions you gave them and shove it into things like Facebook ads, Instagram ads, YouTube ads, Amazon services. Basically, you want them to do whatever it takes to “grow” on paper. VC firms tell startups to not run at a profit.

Running out of money! So a year or so passes by and the founders have spent all your money. The startup you picked grew their user base by 400%! So you go back to the board meeting and say “hey guys, good job, but if we wanna keep this train going we’re gonna need to raise more money” Then they tell their buddies “look at the growth, you should invest in B”.

The Series B round, the second funding round a startup goes through is logically called the Series B. Series B money goes into FB, Goog, Amzn, buying more unprofitable growth, doesn’t matter if it’s sustainable, you’ve been told to grow.

Run out of money + Series C. So your friend, VC Bob, shows off their “returns” to his friends at another VC firm, and they raise a few more millions for the Series C funding round completing Step 7. And throughout all these funding rounds, since all the VC firms are buddy-buddy, they can value these companies at whatever valuation they want! 

Look like a genius. That means on paper to your investment had a 4x ROI!

So for step 9, you start a second fund to invest in more startups, to have more money under management, collecting those management fees, starting the process all over.

So you’re China. And just like how people are competitive, nations are also very competitive where intel and influence are the names of the game. But how do we get said intel and influence? The problem is that the most powerful people in the nations you’re trying to topple, are usually gonna be the strongest supporters of the regime. So, if the logical side of their brain won’t let them betray their country - we need to attack this problem from a more emotional - dirtier angle. What is the one thing that man can’t resist - a man’s insatiable desire for… Women! Yes, if we can use women to get powerful politicians under their spell. We’ll call these spies Swallows, or Ravens for the male counterparts.

A great man once said, power is like real estate, the closer you are to the source, the higher your property. So common sense would dictate that we should use our swallows to target the biggest, most powerful politicians right away.  A long term strategy is to get our foot in the door before the politician gets big and powerful.

Our Swallow has to be top-notch attractive. Another deal breaker is that they have to be naturally charismatic. The best, most ideal Chinese Swallows are educated, they attended the top universities, and of course speak perfect English.

Today, it’s a lot simpler. Everyone, including those in power, are just a click away on social media. It is believed they often use social media - such as LinkedIn and Facebook to connect with their prey as they lure them in. If that doesn’t work, America is a buffet of campaign rallies, political events, fundraisers, community get-togethers, business forums, where you can meet your ideal target and strike up a relationship.

“Every human is a puzzle with a missing piece, learn to fill their need and they’ll give you everything”. The first step is to identify what their deepest desire is. Then in general, you’ll want to draw the man in with an alluring appearance. Once you have them under your spell - make their fantasies come true, nurture their dependence on you and they’ll instantly fall in love. Then, right when they’re in the deepest possible state of love, when they are completely. Drunk. On love - pull back! And boom - this powerful man with the intel and influence you need is now your slave.

But remember, we’re in this for the long run - it’s much better to stay in a relationship without them ever even knowing. You can keep gathering intel on their habits, preferences, schedules, friends. You can use your influence over them to sway the US on important China-related issues.

You find yourself in a new profession, making money as a con man.

Scams come and go, what made money yesterday may not work today but even though the rackets are constantly changing, the mind of a con artist stays the same. 

Almost everything in society is ripe with exploit points for us to profit off of. There’s lottery scams, IRS scams, investment scams, romance scams, charity scams and many more! 

When it comes to picking your target it’s about how easily you can manipulate their emotions to get them to trust you. Once you have your target, now it’s time to put the scam into play.

In general, you’re gonna want to find the weakest link. Which is probably gonna be a low wage worker that isn’t gonna care to double check things or someone working on commission, that is incentivized to “overlook” certain discrepancies in order to close the sale.

While the scam is going on, you want to make sure you look the part. If your racket is getting phony mortgages for example, you want to look clean cut and have all the bank statements and such to back yourself up.

The best con artists are just amazing salesmen. You wanna use that persuasive tonality and body language to get them under your spell.

And there you have it! And just like when a business starts taking off, it’s gonna be pretty exhilarating, addicting, and you’ll want to scale up. The biggest temptation of a criminal is that when things start to heat up, it’s always “oh just one more hit, just one more job, just one more ruse and I’ll be done!” 
Back in the days, con artists had to go face-to-face with the people they were ripping off. But today, most scams are done online, over long distances.

-----------------------
You’re a citizen of the Soviet Union in the early-to-mid 1900’s. An average peasant that’s just trying to get by and live your life in a country that has had a very chaotic history recently. The Russian Revolution just happened in 1917. Everyone stole what they could for survival and for their own personal gain.

This is the Economics of the Russian Mafia. One of the most unique organized crime groups in history, forged in the gulags of the Soviet Union.

The Russian Mafia is very much a byproduct of Russia’s history. This is also what makes the Russian Mafia, AKA the Vory different from the Yakuza or Italian Mafia. They were joined together under the banner of being against the government and authority.

Before the Russian Revolution and Communism in 1917, Russia was ruled by monarchs, kings that they called Tsars. Then came the Revolution. That perfect storm of revolution and war led to that explosion of 7m Mafias around Russia.

The government used gulags as both a state-building/economic tool and as a psychological tool. The goal was to use them economically.

Because there were so many prisoners, the guards needed help. They enlisted the most capable mafia members to keep them productive! This new generation of mafiosos would cement the collaboration between the government and the Russian Mafia.

A new breed emerged to supplement the Soviet Economy: Black Market Entrepreneurs - Secret underground capitalist businessmen who smuggled goods into the country and sold them to make money. The Russian Mafia would offer protection to these business people.They created “Enforcement Partnerships” - where the Russian Mafia would offer business owners the protection the government failed to give them.

Russia was in complete economic turmoil in every aspect during the 90’s. They had the great stock market crash, hyperinflation, etc. So the government was in desperate need of money. They started selling the state’s assets. Small businesses, big corporations, supplies, etc. And who was ready cash in hand to buy these assets? It was the corrupt politicians, insiders, black market entrepreneurs that would later be known as the Russian Oligarchs, and of course - the Russian Mafia. And “in 1994, President Yeltsin declared that Russia was the ‘biggest mafia state in the world’”

-----------------------
You’re a citizen of the Soviet Union in the early-to-mid 1900’s. An average peasant that’s just trying to get by and live your life in a country that has had a very chaotic history recently. The Russian Revolution just happened in 1917. Everyone stole what they could for survival and for their own personal gain.

This is the Economics of the Russian Mafia. One of the most unique organized crime groups in history, forged in the gulags of the Soviet Union.

The Russian Mafia is very much a byproduct of Russia’s history. This is also what makes the Russian Mafia, AKA the Vory different from the Yakuza or Italian Mafia. They were joined together under the banner of being against the government and authority.

Before the Russian Revolution and Communism in 1917, Russia was ruled by monarchs, kings that they called Tsars. Then came the Revolution. That perfect storm of revolution and war led to that explosion of 7m Mafias around Russia.

The government used gulags as both a state-building/economic tool and as a psychological tool. The goal was to use them economically.

Because there were so many prisoners, the guards needed help. They enlisted the most capable mafia members to keep them productive! This new generation of mafiosos would cement the collaboration between the government and the Russian Mafia.

A new breed emerged to supplement the Soviet Economy: Black Market Entrepreneurs - Secret underground capitalist businessmen who smuggled goods into the country and sold them to make money. The Russian Mafia would offer protection to these business people.They created “Enforcement Partnerships” - where the Russian Mafia would offer business owners the protection the government failed to give them.

Russia was in complete economic turmoil in every aspect during the 90’s. They had the great stock market crash, hyperinflation, etc. So the government was in desperate need of money. They started selling the state’s assets. Small businesses, big corporations, supplies, etc. And who was ready cash in hand to buy these assets? It was the corrupt politicians, insiders, black market entrepreneurs that would later be known as the Russian Oligarchs, and of course - the Russian Mafia. And “in 1994, President Yeltsin declared that Russia was the ‘biggest mafia state in the world’”

What if I told you that in 3 months, you could grow a quarter of a century younger?
That’s what a recent scientific study resulted in
There hasn’t been much proof that blood transfusions work. That is where this new study comes to the rescue.
In this study - the cells of participants aged in reverse by the equivalent of a staggering 25 years with something much less invasive than blood transfusions
Most generally accepted ways to slow down aging today only slows your body down by a tiny bit - so 25 years backwards is major
The method that they used to achieve these results isn’t limited to the ultra wealthy

To understand how to cure aging, we first have to understand what causes aging.
Aging is one of those great mysteries in life that’s up there with how consciousness works - so there’s still much debate on what really causes aging
The ends of our chromosomes have what’s called telomeres
You can think of telomeres like the plastic ends on your shoelaces that keep them from fraying
And when your telomeres have been exhausted - that cell can’t divide anymore and it turns into a senescent cell
These zombie cells contribute to things like diabetes, heart disease, and more
This is what researchers at the Tel Aviv University were about to change - to not just slow down the shortening of your telomeres, but to actually regenerate telomeres to make them longer

Hyperbaric Oxygen Chambers are basically where you lay inside a tube that’s pressurized with 100% oxygen

They took 35 adults that were 64 or older and put them through 60 oxygen chamber sessions over the course of 3 months, at 5 sessions per week

Thanks to the oxygen chamber therapy, all the telomeres of these important cells grew by a significant amount, with some telomeres repairing nearly 40% of its length!
The same is true when researchers measured how many of those zombie senescent cells remained

For the first time, we’ve discovered that you can age your blood cells - backwards by 25 years

Should you do this yourself? It depends on how much money you have to throw around
But not all hope is lost if you’re not rolling in cash
As this technology gets more attention, as more people are interested in doing this kind of therapy, as the economies of scale go up - prices will go down

The dream of immortality is a far off one
But this is a step in the right direction

As a politician, your career lives and dies by the number of votes you get. During the 60’s, the public thought it only makes sense that they should be able to vote. To get someone to vote for you, all you have to do is promise to solve whatever their biggest pain point is. College! This is The College Racket: History's Greatest Money Making Scam

The minute students could get loans so they didn’t have to pay out of pocket - colleges started jacking up their prices. Prices started going up, and it became a feeding frenzy. Colleges have started competing on who can have the best amenities to get that tuition money. And with more amenities, bigger campuses, bigger staff, our expenses have gone through the roof!

Let’s take Rutgers University for example: they have over 71,000 students at an average of around $18.5k in tuition each. But universities like Rutgers do have one advantage over these billion dollar companies, it’s that those billions are tax free. So, you opened up your college for business, you have all this tax free money pouring in, you can’t let it just sit there and collect dust, now can you? So what should you do with all this money?

What you shouldn’t do is use it to lower tuition prices bc we gotta keep milking this house of cards for everything it's got! What you should do is hoard the cash - and start a hedge fund! But the problem is, if we call it a hedge fund, it would make us sound too greedy, too money hungry! So let’s call it an endowment! 

“But Jake, we’re in this too deep, we need student loans, schools should get tax benefits bc they’re educating our youth, endowments are important”. When you buy almost any product - if it doesn’t deliver what it promised, you get a refund. So if the promise of a degree is that it’ equals success in the world, why don’t colleges and universities offer a money back guarantee if you don’t get a job?

Now they say that “even though it's our fault that college is this expensive, this time it’s different - we’re just gonna give you free college. So vote for me, please!” I am not a fan of arbitrary student debt relief. I think a step in the right direction would be to let students declare bankruptcy just like any other debt.

So why is the college racket possibly history’s greatest scam? Because most scams like Bernie Madoff ponzi schemes don’t last very long. But with college, the general public has been fooled for decades.

Let's say you run a fortune 500 company. And you wanna get an edge on a business competitor that’s been on your tail. If you could get your hands on your competitors proprietary technology, you could turn the tide on profits! Maybe instead of getting your hands on their technology secrets, maybe you could use some photos of your competitor’s CEO in a “compromised” position? Maybe some internal documents could help?

Spying never changes - it’s all about getting information - intelligence from other humans. Some people will get trained through government intelligence agencies, then quit to sell those skills to the private sector. It’s so bad that some insiders say this intelligence “brain drain” is hurting US national security.

Corporate espionage is expensive. It requires a lot of manpower and expertise that not many people have. On top of that, espionage doesn’t always yield results. So how far people are willing to go to spy on their business enemies depends on how much money is involved.

The major espionage firms claim that they don’t do anything shady. One reason is that unless the intel they get is used for shady things, intel obtained in a shady way isn’t admissible in court. BUT, depending on the laws of the country they’re operating in, almost anything goes.

For every corporate espionage assignment, you’ll get a target to go after: this can be just plain information about something, documents, photographs, etc. Now, not everyone would be willing to betray their company, so the first step is to create a psychological profile of your ideal mole.

Another twist on this method is that if you seduce them but they’re still giving you resistance on the juicy stuff you’re really after, you can try to persuade them to reveal more inconsequential, less important details that are easier to squeeze out - but are still illegal to share none-the-less.

If there’s a king in this corporate espionage game - in this economic espionage game - it’s without a doubt China. If you’ve watched this channel, you know that China’s long term goal is to surpass the US as the world’s greatest superpower.

Part of that strategy is for China to become the market leader in vital industries like tech, aerospace, ai, energy, medicine, biotech, etc. And to become the market leader in any of these fields, you need to develop cutting-edge technology. Which is why China been involved in corporate espionage case after corporate espionage case.

Does the US and other countries spy on foreign businesses? Yes!
But there’s no denying that China is the undisputed master at this.

the CIA’s Special Activities Division, or SAD. Basically, it’s the CIA’s secret military. The idea of this game is to shine a light on how both sides of the Cold War got their hands dirty. But how much of this is true? And how much of Black Ops Cold War is pure fiction?

On August 6th 1945, the US dropped the ""Little Boy"" over Hiroshima. Three days later, humanity witnessed the second ""Fat Man"" over Nagasaki.

In 1949, the Soviet Union which is America’s new enemy, conducted its first test - code-named 'RDS-1' which looked similar to America’s Fat Man. That’s where the Venona Project came to the rescue. A counterintelligence operation created to intercept and decrypt messages from the Soviet Union’s intelligence agencies. 

One year after that first Soviet test, the Venona Project pointed to an atomic spy named Klaus Fuchs who was eventually arrested that led to the arrest of atomic spy David Greenglass who would then help convict his sister and brother in-law: two Soviet spies named Ethel and Julius Rosenberg.

Another unidentified spy at Los Alamos that went by the code name PERS - or Perseus. But when the Venona decryptions were released in 1995, it became clear that Perseus was a mere disinformation campaign to hide the real atomic spy that was active at the time - Theodore Hall. 

One of the more unexpected locations in Black Ops Cold War is Miami. Castro took over Cuba in 1959. A year after Castro took power, the CIA made it its job to off him and overthrow the Communist government, codename Operation Mongoose. They built a new CIA station out in Miami, code-named JMWAVE.

Another prominent location the game showed off was Angola. Angola became what you can call a surrogate battleground, or a proxy war between the US and the Soviets.

Another location that I didn’t know much about was the Ural Mountains. This area became the center of the Soviet’s nuclear weapons effort.

One of the more prominent missions shown off was the one located in Turkey. It made for a great spot to launch CIA operations against the Soviets.

So how much truth is there in Black Ops Cold War? Well, it’s like movies that are based on true events.

You’ve gotten hooked on sci-fi movies like Interstellar and modern day explorers like Elon Musk, and now you’re obsessed with the idea of exploring and colonizing space. But one of the bottlenecks of space exploration right now is simple: costs! As long as it takes that much money to launch water, building structures, and raw materials into space - space exploration and space colonies are gonna move at a slow rate. Let’s explore the next trillion dollar industry - Space Mining.

Asteroids are clumps of leftover rock and dust from when the planets were forming in our solar system. Back in 2005, Japan’s Hayabusa spacecraft landed on the surface of an asteroid after a two year flight. The Hayabusa docked on the floating rock for two years, collected a tiny sample of the asteroid along with a ton of data, and started it’s flight back where it returned to Earth in 2010. This mission was what really sparked this new space race for extraterrestrial mining.

The first type of asteroids are ones that contain valuable metals. These types of asteroids are thought to have formed during the formation of planets like ours. Like 16 Psyche for example. The problem with mining metal asteroids is that even if you extracted a bunch of metals, by the time you got it back to Earth, you would’ve spent more money than it would’ve cost to just mine the materials here.

The second type of asteroids come in C-types, which contain something that we have plenty of here, but is worth its weight in gold out in space: water. The first entrepreneurs that are able to mine water from asteroids would be able to sell something right away in space that every space traveller will need - fuel.

Because asteroids are so small, they’re held together by just a tiny amount of gravity. This means engineers have to get a little creative with how they plan on mining. One innovative company paving the way for extracting water out of asteroids is called Trans Astra.

When this new space race for extraterrestrial mining was sparked back in 2010 when Japan’s Hayabusa craft returned - a new startup quickly emerged. Not too long after, Planetary Resources got its own competitor: Deep Space Industries. These two became the icons of the space mining effort.

The days of oil being the hot new thing are far behind us - but space mining? The person that figures out how to do that profitably, will probably become the modern day trillionaire - Rockefeller.

You’ve gotten hooked on sci-fi movies like Interstellar and modern day explorers like Elon Musk, and now you’re obsessed with the idea of exploring and colonizing space. But one of the bottlenecks of space exploration right now is simple: costs! As long as it takes that much money to launch water, building structures, and raw materials into space - space exploration and space colonies are gonna move at a slow rate. Let’s explore the next trillion dollar industry - Space Mining.

Asteroids are clumps of leftover rock and dust from when the planets were forming in our solar system. Back in 2005, Japan’s Hayabusa spacecraft landed on the surface of an asteroid after a two year flight. The Hayabusa docked on the floating rock for two years, collected a tiny sample of the asteroid along with a ton of data, and started it’s flight back where it returned to Earth in 2010. This mission was what really sparked this new space race for extraterrestrial mining.

The first type of asteroids are ones that contain valuable metals. These types of asteroids are thought to have formed during the formation of planets like ours. Like 16 Psyche for example. The problem with mining metal asteroids is that even if you extracted a bunch of metals, by the time you got it back to Earth, you would’ve spent more money than it would’ve cost to just mine the materials here.

The second type of asteroids come in C-types, which contain something that we have plenty of here, but is worth its weight in gold out in space: water. The first entrepreneurs that are able to mine water from asteroids would be able to sell something right away in space that every space traveller will need - fuel.

Because asteroids are so small, they’re held together by just a tiny amount of gravity. This means engineers have to get a little creative with how they plan on mining. One innovative company paving the way for extracting water out of asteroids is called Trans Astra.

When this new space race for extraterrestrial mining was sparked back in 2010 when Japan’s Hayabusa craft returned - a new startup quickly emerged. Not too long after, Planetary Resources got its own competitor: Deep Space Industries. These two became the icons of the space mining effort.

The days of oil being the hot new thing are far behind us - but space mining? The person that figures out how to do that profitably, will probably become the modern day trillionaire - Rockefeller.

This was the very first episode of the Joe Rogan Experience all the way back in 2009.
Only around 100 people were watching live. A little over 10 years later, this would not only become the biggest podcast in the world, but the most valuable at $100 million dollars after signing to Spotify recently.

The crazy part is that before the podcast, Joe Rogan has had one of the most diverse careers any major “influencers” have ever had. So let’s take a look at the meteoric career of who’s gotta be one of the most influential figures of our time - Joe Rogan.

Joseph James Rogan didn’t have the worst childhood ever, but it also wasn’t that great according to him. Growing up in a troubled household, Joe Rogan developed an extremely obsessive personality. He was very interested in what he was interested in, and very uninterested in people telling him what to do.

He got into martial arts and that became the focus of his life. This was the first time in Joe’s life where he didn’t feel like a loser. Instantly, Joe’s obsessiveness was 100% directed at training and fighting. Within two years he earned his black belt. At age 19, Joe started pondering the idea of fighting professionally.

Joe and his martial arts friends were always in an intense environment. The idea of being a comedian never crossed his mind until his friends encouraged him to try it out. Mix that with the motivation to find a way out of fighting, and Joe found himself doing open mic nights. It went really well and within one year Joe found himself in LA for the next phase of his career.

The first sitcom show was called Hardball, but it got cancelled. He ended up starring on a hit sitcom called Newsradio. That show went on for 5 seasons while he was doing stand up on the side. Once the show ended, NBC pitched the idea of him hosting a new show without actors called Fear Factor. This was when his comedy career really reached a new level.

The first episode of the Joe Rogan Experience aired in December 2009. What started out as Joe just bantering with comedian friends eventually became a weekly thing, then they got it on iTunes. JRE now spans across the globe with over 1500 episodes. And today, the podcast has some truly incomprehensible numbers.

So what can we take away from Joe? The key to Genius, to being a genius, to doing something great like Joe, is the ability to connect different disciplines together. Be a jack of all trades, and a master… of one.

A Senator has his staffers draft up a bill that would effectively put you out of business. 

When the government threatens your business’s livelihood like this, you hire a lobbyist in DC to do the work for you. And you just turned into a “special interest group” that just hired their first lobbyist.

The main reason why people hire lobbyists is to get the government to stop doing something, or to get the government to do something that would benefit them. Whatever the reason is, this is why the business of legal bribes is so big.

In business, people sell goods and services, in DC, lobbyists sell ideas their clients want them to sell. If you do it right, politicians will never even realize they’re being legally bribed. The last thing you want to do is to scream and yell at these politicians about how “if you don’t support this bill...l!” But at the same time, the conversation is almost never just “give me $100,000 and I’ll vote this way”. No matter who you are, if someone does something for you without asking, you’re gonna be compelled to return the favor in order to maintain your self image as a fair, just person.

In January 2006, Jack Abramoff was sentenced to six years in federal prison for conspiracy to bribe public officials, tax evasion, etc. They were accused of secretly splitting multi-million dollar profits. Abramoff became the poster child for everything that was wrong with big money in politics. If he was the biggest and only villain in DC, when he finally went to prison - why didn’t corruption in DC end?

Everyone cringes at the thought of dirty “special interest” groups and “lobbyists” - but are they the only problem? Are they the only ones in Washington with “special” interests? After all, the only thing that gives these “evil” lobbyists any power is because of the simple fact that the politicians have power to be bought in the first place! The bigger the government gets, the more potential for corruption there will be. If you believe in that, you’re gonna have to accept that big money will always be a part of big politics.

Rockefeller is often remembered as the richest man in history, the king of the greedy capitalist pigs. Yet, since he got his first job as a broke 16 year old, one thing he always made time for, no matter how broke he was, was charitable giving. So before you go complaining about how big corporations rule the world and how unfair life is - the solution might just be right inside your wallet.

Howard Jacobson runs a pharmacy in Long Island New York. A common drug Howard and other pharmacies sell is called Metformin. The drug itself only costs Jacobson $1.61. If the patient paid with cash out-of-pocket for the drug, Jacobson would sell it to them for $4.00, earning him a respectable $2.39 in profit. The patient used their insurance plan where the patient had to pay $10.84 for the drug instead of $4. Jacobson the pharmacist ends up making only $1.93 in profit. Higher cost for the patient, lower profit for the pharmacy. That whopping $8.91 goes to the insurance company and their middlemen. 

Manufacturers sell their products to retailers. Consumers buy those products from the retailers at a higher price. That way the retailers make some profit to keep for themselves, and they get to buy more products from the manufacturers. The big pharma supply chain is a lot more complicated. 

Big Pharma companies spend billions to develop drugs and to try to get them to pass the FDA. This is the first reason why drugs can get so expensive. They are doing all the work, so it’s a little bit more understandable.

Wholesalers transport the drugs and sell them to the pharmacies. The patient gets prescribed medication from their doctor and goes to the pharmacy to get their meds. Most patients have health insurance to save money on big medical expenses. They use their insurance to pay for prescription meds. For the remainder of the costs, the pharmacy sends a bill to the patient’s insurance company. The patient feels as if they're getting their money’s worth from their insurance. 

Insurance companies are in the business of making money, not giving away free charity. Patients pay their monthly bill for insurance, and when medical bills arise, the patient would pay the entire bill themselves, and the insurance companies would just sit back and collect that monthly bill. The lower the copay they pay, the more you have to fork up to cover their costs and the less profit you make. 

Drug companies pay a commission back to the insurance company. We call these “rebates”. And the people responsible for negotiating how big of a rebate, the insurance companies get falls onto the broker.

Brokers are those middlemen that negotiate with the drug makers to get as much money back for the insurance companies as possible.

It’s easy to blame drug companies, insurance companies and their “Pharmacy Benefit Managers,”. Everyone gets stuck with a higher bill. Mix in the other incentives of drug companies, insurance companies, middlemen and prices for things like big pharma drugs and everything else - skyrocket!

Howard Jacobson runs a pharmacy in Long Island New York. A common drug Howard and other pharmacies sell is called Metformin. The drug itself only costs Jacobson $1.61. If the patient paid with cash out-of-pocket for the drug, Jacobson would sell it to them for $4.00, earning him a respectable $2.39 in profit. The patient used their insurance plan where the patient had to pay $10.84 for the drug instead of $4. Jacobson the pharmacist ends up making only $1.93 in profit. Higher cost for the patient, lower profit for the pharmacy. That whopping $8.91 goes to the insurance company and their middlemen. 

Manufacturers sell their products to retailers. Consumers buy those products from the retailers at a higher price. That way the retailers make some profit to keep for themselves, and they get to buy more products from the manufacturers. The big pharma supply chain is a lot more complicated. 

Big Pharma companies spend billions to develop drugs and to try to get them to pass the FDA. This is the first reason why drugs can get so expensive. They are doing all the work, so it’s a little bit more understandable.

This is the race against aging.

In Scottsdale, Arizona lies a unique company called the Alcor Life Extension Foundation. One of only four companies in the entire world that specializes in Cryonics. For an affordable price $50/mo + life insurance, Alcor will have a medical team for you on standby. Once the day arrives when you’re pronounced dead, they’ll rush a team out to your body, and then rush your body back to their facility where they’ll “freeze” your body to cool. They’ll keep your body there until hopefully one day, we’ll be able to revive you back to life. 

Before Sept 2013, the field of aging and life extension was pretty pathetic. But a man named Bill Marris was about to change that stigma. He pitched the idea for a startup aimed at curing aging to the Google co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin and they loved it. 

On Sept 18, 2013, Google’s mysterious new company called Calico launched in an effort to manufacture something that Silicon Valley has never been able to make: time. And this new movement has led to some remarkable advancements in recent years, including the rise of one Professor by the name of David Sinclair. 

As time goes by, your DNA gets naturally damaged from things like UV light, so your cells have to repair your DNA and epigenome. Sinclair has been able to figure out ways to slow down the damage to your epigenome, and thus, slow down aging. We’re able to reverse aging all together for a group of cells. He’s working on how to reverse the age of the entire body. David Sinclair has been featured on Joe Rogan, Veratasium, etc.

Then there’s Neuralink from Elon Musk. Instead of curing aging head on or freezing you after you die, Neuralink’s goal is to work around your existing body. That’s where their brain machine interface comes in - a computer chip that wires directly to your brain. Neuralink’s goal is to not only read these signals, but to also send the right signals to your brain to counteract things like memory loss, hearing loss, blindness, paralysis, depression, strokes, and more.

Solving immortality? “The world has witnessed big plays before, but what was bigger than death?” “When forever comes, will we be able to survive it?”

As the president of the US you run into a lot of problems. To solve these problems, one of the options you can use is diplomacy. However, sometimes diplomacy just won’t cut it. Whatever the reason is, if diplomacy doesn’t work. The President’s third option, or tertia optio as it’s called behind closed doors.

Covert action can be a whole range of things - from drone strikes, to sabotage, to paramilitary operations, snatch and grabs, to funding and training rebels around the world that oppose our enemies.

Let’s learn how you as the President and the CIA can protect the free world, with your third option

The first thing to understand is this is the most extreme measure that should only be used when you’ve tried every other option. The next step is to stop calling it by you know what! The final decision to “eliminate” someone should always be reached in the field where the “neutralization” will be taking place. Once the decision has been reached, how you’re gonna “preemptively neutralize” someone is gonna vary largely based on the situation.

The best “lethal direct actions,” are the ones that aren’t even considered neutralizations in the first place. There are a few different variables we have to account for - the awareness of the subject, the desired outcome of our guy, and concealment. So now that you sorted out the different variables, let’s move onto the neutralizer itself.

Selecting your neutralizer will be based on whether it’s a safe or lost job. For a lost case, the hitman needs to be a genuine fanatic of some sort. If you intend for your neutralizer to escape, the CIA typically recruits former Special Forces operators because they’re pretty much the perfect candidates. And once you have your neutralizer or neutralizers, it’s time to plan out that preemptive neutralization.

The entire point of neutralization is the absolute death of the subject! Blunt objects come in handy since you’ll be able to find one where the target is and it’s less likely to scream “this was a professional job!”  For secret cases like that where you don’t want people knowing it was a hit, accidents are your best bet.

Now you know the origin of these covert action operations. It’s time to get out there, and get to work.

Louis the 14th was perhaps the last great monarch. The man reigned over France for a whole 72 years. Two generations later and you had Louis the 16th - the last monarch of France. Humanity decided that they finally had enough of the idea that their rights belonged to the gods and kings that ruled over them. They now believe that their sovereign rights belonged to the people. This is definitely an inconvenience to the aspiring power-hungry individual like ourselves but even though you can’t be king anymore, there is an alternative.

We need a better way of seizing power. With every single crisis there’s an opportunity. 
The more larger-than-life, the more god-like you appear to the masses, the easier everything will be. View yourself as kind of like a religious leader, but instead of traditional religion, you preach your political religion. You want people to worship you exactly like how they would worship a cult leader or a prophet since democracies are based on the support of the people, on the vote of the people. 

Your political ideology is just for appearances. As Shakespeare said, “All the world’s a stage” - and as a political cult leader, you have to treat yourself as an actor. Every word, every gesture, every tonal change in your voice, every aspect of your body language contributes to putting the populace under your spell. The more public support you have, the easier it will be to rise up in power. 

As you get more power, you want to use mass media to make yourself omnipresent. Plaster your face literally everywhere. Have your writings and speeches on repeat on news stations, social media, radio. Have MSM promote and spread positive stories about yourself while silencing dissenters. Rename streets, cities, factories after your holiness like Stalin did. Exaggerate your story like Kim Il-sung did with his background on how he had super powers, could fly through the air, tunnel through mountains. Basically, you want your subjects to feel as if wherever they go, their great leader is watching over their shoulders 24/7

Make it a requirement to publicly praise and worship you or else they’ll face some severe punishments. Dictatorship has used labor camps as the go-to punishment. This combination of pure fear and heavenly worship makes for a powerful mix.

To increase your power, all you have to do is scale up the insanity. And if you do your job right, the next generation that grows up under your rule will have no idea of how things were in the before-world. 

PS, does anyone else love the movie The Death of Stalin?

A tribute to Daniel Craig, James Bond, and the new 007: No Time To Die film.

What is one of oldest human occupations? You guessed it - spies, gathering intel, espionage! And because information about our enemies, about the world around us is so vital to our basic survival - spying quickly emerged as humanity’s oldest occupation. As Sun Tzu said, if you think about it, the only way to get ahead in life, to crush your enemies and take the throne, you’re gonna need foreknowledge - intelligence! So the million-dollar question becomes how do you go about getting said intel from other men? Let’s learn the art of spycraft

Spycraft is one of the most misunderstood and misrepresented professions in the world. Espionage is all about collecting that juicy intel on our enemies. The first way to collect intel is Overtly through reading the newspapers, the press, and all the public information that comes out of an enemy’s country. The clandestine intel collection, or espionage - the professional name for it, always has a place in this world

The “essence” of espionage is access. You choose the objective of what intel you want to know about your enemy. You need to get an agent or some device close enough to the target, to get access to the target, to gather the intel you need. Your agent then has to deliver the intel to you without it getting lost or intercepted enroute.

There are five different types of spies: Native spies, Internal spies, Double agent spies, Expendable spies, and living spies. These types of spies have their limits. This is where plants come in.

Planted agents are agents that are somehow able to penetrate the target and stay there for an extended period of time. The only way to have planted agents today is either by using illegals or by turning someone who’s already on the inside. Your job is to simply learn a potential traitor's key pain points, and make them an offer they can’t refuse.

To collect that intel, agents can place bugs, hidden cameras, take pictures with their phone, etc. Getting that intel back to their superiors is a different story.

If you’re gonna subvert your enemies with spies, you can bet that they’re gonna try to do the same to your nation with their own set of spies. This is where counterintelligence comes in where you basically just do the opposite of what you do to spy on other nations. Once you have an enemy spy under your control, start by having them report back real intel to their superiors.

-----------------------
On August 28th, Elon Musk’s secretive startup, Neuralink, live streamed a major update on their brain-machine interface that will turn humans into cyborgs.

The biggest existential threat to humanity is not nuclear war, climate change, or even war but artificial intelligence. As Ai gets smarter, do things better and faster than us, more jobs get automated and more people are left in the dust. 

The oldest part of our brains is our limbic system. The threat of Ai calls for a better, newer layer of the human brain that is able to catch up to its computer counterparts. We need a digital super intelligence layer as Elon likes to call it. This is where Neuralink comes in. A tiny computer that is mounted to your skull, hooks up wires directly to your brain so that we can hopefully have a symbiosis with Ai. Neuralink will be used to cure a lot of brain and spine problems. If we had a device that corrects these signals, we would be able to solve almost all of these disorders that cause a lot of suffering in the world.

The biggest update they announced was their Three Little Pigs demo. The first little pig was Joyce, the control of the experiment. The second pig was playing around and didn’t want to come out right away. The third pig, Darthy, used to have a neuralink implant but had it removed. Finally, we were able to lure Gertrude out who has a Neuralink installed in her brain and is still as happy and healthy as the other pigs. Neuralink is actually working!

If you implanted a neuralink in a person’s brain, and another one after where their spinal cord is severed, the first implant picks up that data, and sends it to the second implant past the spinal cord injury, thus allowing them to walk again naturally.

When they first unveiled their N1 prototype last year, it was pretty complex, and getting it installed was pretty hard. You would have to drill multiple holes into your skull for the sensors, then tunnel those wires underneath your skin down to the back of your ear, and you would still need to have a device connected to the outside of your body behind your ear for the battery and bluetooth. The new prototype they unveiled, version 0.9, is drastically simplified. 

The biggest challenges remaining involve the material science, fully automating the surgery from start to finish with the robot and working out the logistics of productionizing a very complicated digital medical device.

-----------------------
On August 28th, Elon Musk’s secretive startup, Neuralink, live streamed a major update on their brain-machine interface that will turn humans into cyborgs.

The biggest existential threat to humanity is not nuclear war, climate change, or even war but artificial intelligence. As Ai gets smarter, do things better and faster than us, more jobs get automated and more people are left in the dust. 

The oldest part of our brains is our limbic system. The threat of Ai calls for a better, newer layer of the human brain that is able to catch up to its computer counterparts. We need a digital super intelligence layer as Elon likes to call it. This is where Neuralink comes in. A tiny computer that is mounted to your skull, hooks up wires directly to your brain so that we can hopefully have a symbiosis with Ai. Neuralink will be used to cure a lot of brain and spine problems. If we had a device that corrects these signals, we would be able to solve almost all of these disorders that cause a lot of suffering in the world.

The biggest update they announced was their Three Little Pigs demo. The first little pig was Joyce, the control of the experiment. The second pig was playing around and didn’t want to come out right away. The third pig, Darthy, used to have a neuralink implant but had it removed. Finally, we were able to lure Gertrude out who has a Neuralink installed in her brain and is still as happy and healthy as the other pigs. Neuralink is actually working!

If you implanted a neuralink in a person’s brain, and another one after where their spinal cord is severed, the first implant picks up that data, and sends it to the second implant past the spinal cord injury, thus allowing them to walk again naturally.

When they first unveiled their N1 prototype last year, it was pretty complex, and getting it installed was pretty hard. You would have to drill multiple holes into your skull for the sensors, then tunnel those wires underneath your skin down to the back of your ear, and you would still need to have a device connected to the outside of your body behind your ear for the battery and bluetooth. The new prototype they unveiled, version 0.9, is drastically simplified. 

The biggest challenges remaining involve the material science, fully automating the surgery from start to finish with the robot and working out the logistics of productionizing a very complicated digital medical device.

There are only a few things in life a man truly desires: power, money and you know what. You could get a job, start a business or you could become a famous celebrity or athlete. But there’s one more route you can take instead of sucking up to your boss, you’re the boss that people don’t just follow, but worship. And when someone worships you, you could easily get them in bed with you.

Cult leaders get so much money, power, and you know what, that it would make the kings and tyrants of the past very jealous of you. You get to sit at the top of society. Your disciples view you as their benevolent leader showing them the light to salvation. 

When you think of cults, you typically imagine some rather crazy people doing weird rituals, getting abused, drinking Kool-Aid laced with cyanide voluntarily. The majority of cult members are usually smart, educated, normal good people, that just were lacking something in their lives that the cult was able to fill.

As an aspiring cult leader, the number one thing you have to understand is that people just want to feel important. This is what you're selling to your disciples. The more important they feel, the less likely they’ll ever want to go back to their normal ordinary lives.

You need to play either as a Messenger of whatever God you choose, a prophet, or even God himself. You have to make them feel as if you’re their only hope. All you have to do is offer something new that is still able to give them a higher purpose, instead of just an improvement offer. 

View each person you recruit with a price tag. Once you get more disciples in, train them to be over-the-top pumped when welcoming newcomers. They’ll become the movement’s best salespeople who bring in their own friends. 

There are a few things you want to accomplish: provide a new way of life for your subjects, complete and utter separation from the outside world, create a culture of donating to the church. To accomplish this atmosphere within the cult, we have an entire smorgasbord of different tactics we can use.

Start out with making donations a voluntary thing, but eventually, you want to make it a requirement to prove your loyalty to the cause. Eavesdrop on your followers before congregations to find out what their troubles are and then miraculously bring it up during your sermon or use fake actors that look all feeble in a wheelchair and then after some grand gestures, they can all of a sudden walk! The last tactic we’re gonna cover is making your disciples WORK. This is where hard labor comes in!

You’ve done pretty well for yourself and your family. But ironically, the world you enriched thinks that you should be punished the most! That you should pay your “fair share” with their greedy “progressive” tax system.

Not paying taxes is a puzzle. When you operate a business that is registered in the majority of modern countries like the US, you’re legally required to have your name on the business in one way or another. The key is getting your name off of the business, off of any paperwork, and to make sure that even if the US really wanted to with a warrant, they can never find out who actually owns the business. 

Shell companies are official companies that you can open and control, but it can’t be traced back to you. This way, you can open up a shell company, move your money through it, and since your name isn’t attached to the shell company, tax collectors won’t be able to charge you. The problem is that there is no way in hell the countries like the US would allow full-blown shell companies to be created.

Tax Havens are usually small countries that don’t really have much going for them, so they offer an extremely enticing business environment to attract foreign businesses to work with them and collect fees. There are four main qualifiers that a country is a tax haven 1. The country has little or no taxes. 2. They have very convenient financial products and incentives 3. The financial activities of the country lack transparency And lastly, the country doesn’t cooperate with other countries to give away their clients' identities. Once you have a tax haven in mind, it’s time to start your shell company.

You’re gonna choose a company in that tax haven that offers these financial services for sale. You can either buy a brand new shell company, or they’ll have existing ones that have a history of transactions already to make it look more legitimate. Once you purchase a shell, you're gonna have to determine Who’s gonna be the shareholder of the company, choose the directors and open up a bank account under your new anonymous shell company. Now it’s time to put your tax haven to work.

Our goal is to not pay taxes and move the money offshore into our Shell, so it can’t be taxed. Then, you have to eventually get the money back home. If authorities smell any potential wrongdoing, these are the things they’re gonna investigate: how you entered the offshore world, how you got your money offshore, and how you got it back to shore.

You want to be a modern day monopoly man. Modern day monopolists have so much power that they’re basically the equivalent to kings and queens and everything people fantasize about being a rich entrepreneur. Your first instinct to model the old robber barons of the past, like Rockefeller and Carnegie. Start a linear business where resources go in, products come out, and then you buy up the entire supply chain for that product. The problem with this traditional route is that it’s outdated. Today’s monopolists are much different. Instead of buying up more factories, it’s all about acquiring more users. Zuckerberg, Bezos, Pichai, all get their fair share of criticism these days. They’re idolized as the greatest entrepreneurs of their time. We collectively create these monopolies ourselves. Screw the old monopolists, let’s join the ranks of the new monopolists. 

Platforms are the one thing that all these new age monopolists have in common. Networks of users are the one thing that allows us to monopolize. Controlling the networks is the safest, most sustainable, and most profitable way to go. The platform entrepreneurs are the secrets behind today’s all powerful monopolists.

All a platform is a network where producers and consumers can meet and exchange value. Building one and getting it off the ground is much harder than a traditional linear business where resources go in and goods come out. The first step in your monopolistic journey is picking the right market.

The most important question you have to answer in your quest for your monopoly platform is what is the Core Transaction? If the platform is the modern day factory, the core transaction is the assembly line. Step 2 in our assembly line is a user connecting with another to spark that exchange. Step 3 is simple - once consumers find the right match, they consume the producer’s inventory. And step 4, consumers give value back to the producer in exchange for what they consumed. It’s so important to get each step as efficient as possible.

Start audience building. As the network gets bigger it’s gonna get harder and harder to connect the right consumers with the right producers. Offer tools and services. Platforms are by far one of the hardest businesses to build today because you run into the chicken and egg problem. Make sure your platform is healthy with audience building, matchmaking, rules and standards, tools and services. We need to lay the groundwork, the platform for entrepreneurs to build off in space.

You want to be a modern day monopoly man. Modern day monopolists have so much power that they’re basically the equivalent to kings and queens and everything people fantasize about being a rich entrepreneur. Your first instinct to model the old robber barons of the past, like Rockefeller and Carnegie. Start a linear business where resources go in, products come out, and then you buy up the entire supply chain for that product. The problem with this traditional route is that it’s outdated. Today’s monopolists are much different. Instead of buying up more factories, it’s all about acquiring more users. Zuckerberg, Bezos, Pichai, all get their fair share of criticism these days. They’re idolized as the greatest entrepreneurs of their time. We collectively create these monopolies ourselves. Screw the old monopolists, let’s join the ranks of the new monopolists.

You’re the head of China - once one of the greatest empires in the world. But in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s, China was defeated by the British, French, Japan, Russia and was put to shame on the world stage for over 100 years.

Because of all this shame and disgrace, you’ve grown to resent not just the West, but the rest of the East, the North, the South.

We need a new plan of attack, where we don’t have to go head first into America’s greatest strength and our main weakness. No longer “using force to compel” the enemy to your will, but rather by using all means.

Make the West believe that you support free trade and globalization, while systematically taking advantage of it. You tell other countries like the US to say “no!” to protectionism, tariffs. China’s main strategy and advantage over the US is the ability to think in decades and centuries. The US on the other hand has grown weak and comfortable.

China’s economic power is the glue that holds the house of cards together. China has complete control over the economy. All this economic power allows us to move onto other fronts of this new cold war.

Infrastructure is one of the most important aspects of a society. Within China, we’re focused on making our economy completely independent from the outside world, where we’re not dependent on exports or imports.

While we’re making our infrastructure most robust at home, this is where the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, comes in.

In celebration of the release of the Ghost of Tsushima

So you come across the Yakuza - Japan’s organized crime syndicates. They offer structure, a surrogate family to be a part of, and provides you with a way to climb up the ranks of society. Being a Yakuza means that the same society that looked down upon you, would now have to bow down to you in fear and submission.

Today’s Yakuza have grown to be much more sophisticated. Instead of just gangsters, the smart ones are now economic gangsters, or Keizai Yakuza. Instead of just your typical rackets like extortion, gambling, drug dealing which still very much happens - they’ve catapulted themselves into the world of high finance, legitimate businesses, the stock market, real estate investments, multinational corporations. You’re gonna have to understand the economics of the Yakuza.

The Yamaguchi-gumi is structured kinda like the American Mafia. One of the main differences between the Yakuza and other crime organizations like the Mafia is the oyabun-kobun relationship, which literally translates to “father role-child role”. The Godfather is part of the upper management that makes all the syndicate’s big. Then there’s the grunts of the syndicate that do all the dirty work and runs all the gang’s different money making operations.

The Yamaguchi-gumi was bringing in well over $460 million dollars annually, or over $1.3 billion dollars in today’s money. Yakuza are integrated into society, they’re very open about their numbers to researchers and the press - making the Yakuza, one of the most well-researched syndicates out there. And Godfathers will make around $400/yr, or around $1m/yr in today’s money.

The Yakuza also have some unwritten rules that must be followed, or else you’ll face some dire consequences: Never reveal secrets of Yakuza, No withholding money from family, Always be obedient to superiors, Don’t appeal to police or the law.

As Japan ended Feudalism with democracy and industry, these Yakuza gangs adjusted to the modernizing economy. The old Yakuza are fading out and the new generation are much more violent, care less about chivalry, honor, traditions, and only really care about money.

Let’s say you’re an idealist that was recently inspired by the ideas of universal basic income, free health care or completely opposite ideas like smaller limited government to let the free market do it’s thing. So you set out to put your plan to change the rules of the game. But you quickly run into inefficient politicians and bureaucrats - the classic problem of monopolies. 

We’ve had the agricultural revolution, the commercial and industrial revolutions, but why not a governance revolution? Enter the sea.

Seasteading or floating cities on the sea, where “aquatic citizens” live in modular pods that can detach and join other cities at any time would be in international waters.

Before you call this impossible, we already have cities and other giant structures on the sea. They’re called cruise ships. Japan’s many giant floating airports,the Netherlands, hundreds of amphibious homes, container ships. Shell’s floating natural gas facility that’s longer than the empire state building, nuclear submarines, nuclear aircraft carriers that can stay at sea for 15 to 20 years before refueling. This is the race for the Aquatic Age.

The basic idea behind seasteads starts with the platform. The floating platform can be built out of steel, concrete, or things like carbon fiber, all of which are already used in water-related projects. Once you have the platforms, you can build anything on top of it. Cruise ships are the perfect example of ocean cities. They have more amenities than the average town. 

What’s the difference between the Koreas? Simple - the rules, the laws, how they govern over their subjects. 

Hong Kong was ruled by the British until they eventually gave it back to China. China was so impressed with the success of Hong Kong that it designated Hong Kong as a special economic zone. Today, Hong Kong has the most expensive real estate in the world and has the second most billionaires in the world behind New York.

Shenzhen, another SEZ in China, has risen to the hardware capital of the world

Singapore doesn’t have many natural resources besides their harbor. They have universal health care yet the government makes more money than it spends. They follow typical English laws yet they dish out death sentences over zoom

Seasteading isn’t the answer to our most complex problems. The answer is more experiments in government.

You’re an idealist that wants to change the world. You view the world as corrupt and oppressive. You want to prevent the plebeian masses from stripping you down, we have to learn how to communicate the change we want in a way that actually gets through to people’s thick heads. 

Revolutions are just a part of human civilization. It is a change from whatever the status quo was at the time. For example, Elon Musk is the main revolutionary of the ideology that humans should be an interplanetary species. The core of it all, is the never-ending power struggle.

The Haves sit at the top of the hierarchy, they have most of the resources, and are the smallest in number.

The Have-nots are the largest in number at the very bottom of the hierarchy. They resent the Haves. They hate the upper class’s legal system, their police, their opulence. And because they’re already at the lowest of the low, once that flame starts, the only direction they can go is up.

And then there’s the Have-a-Little, Want Some More crowd - AKA the Middle Class. Stuck right in the middle. This makes the Middle Class have sort-of a split personality: to revolution, or to not revolution. Most of the Middle Class are Do-Nothings. But in reality - they’re not gonna do much, and will typically choose the safe route to make sure they come out on top.

Every single revolution can be traced back to these three classes: The Haves have the power, the Have-Nots become resentful of their power. The resentment simmers over time until boom. Until the revolutionaries slowly morph into the system they once condemned. So is the tragedy of human civilization.

Before you tearing down the system, treat your revolution like a movie. Set the stage, present the problem, distinguish the good and bad guys. Your real job is to change the public’s mind first, make them feel disgusted and enslaved by the system and your revolution will take care of itself.

Revolutions start with an ideology and your job is to nurture and infect the ideology of your choosing into as many people as possible. Pick your ideology and spread your gospel. One insanely effective tactic you can use is the Angry Mob. Now you may be saying to yourself It does take a lot of wok. You may be wondering what the purpose of all this is. But what is life without a greater purpose that’s bigger than yourself to fight for? That’s a life not worth living.

-----------------------
THIS is the nation of CHAZ, the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, who recently changed their name to CHOP. CHAZ is the world’s newest nation and was founded in the heart of Seattle by colonists who ripped away land from the local population. CHAZ was founded on very noble causes. But not so noble was the fact that the moment the nation was formed - a border wall was put up, border patrol guards, a monarch filled the power vacuum etc. 

The root of every country and economy is the government. CHAZ, or CHOP, first identified as an “Autonomous Zone”.  They're modelling the idea of an “Autonomous Zone” coined by Hakim Bey. These autonomous zones can be used as a tactic by anarchists to sneak anarchy into formal society. Or it could be that these dissenters wanted a cool name and just power hungry. 

CHAZ is more of complete chaotic anarchy. Once CHAZ was formed, the Chazians found themselves with a new monarch - a war lord that declared his power, Raz Simone. But Raz isn’t the only one that’s power hungry in CHAZ, as there are other people challenging his rule, leaders trying to organize things in the background.

You know, what do they make, what are they known for, how does this economy make money? We’ll just have to do an estimate. CHAZ strives to be an independent nation with a thriving agricultural industry. Other industries include street markets, bazaars, a very popular street art culture. And of course, you can’t forget about the classic business of extorting local business owners for protection money. Stability is the name of the game. And CHAZ, has none! CHAZ’s economy has one thing that no other nation in the world has - the complete, indisputable support from another gov’t.

Another thing an economy needs is safety. Since CHAZ bans police, they had to build a very elite group of police, medics, and border patrol guards from scratch.  There’s no pesky things like freedom of religion. 

After the recent shootings, the Major claims that they’re gonna take back the police station. If you’re the leaders of CHAZ and you don’t control the violence, if you can’t keep the image of just a peaceful protest - you will be crushed. CHAZ did the smart thing by changing its name from CHAZ, the Capital Hill Autonomous Zone, to CHOP, the Capital Hill “Occupied Protest”. 

Before you start a revolution, make sure you have a detailed plan in place or else things will very quickly descend into chaos

-----------------------
THIS is the nation of CHAZ, the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, who recently changed their name to CHOP. CHAZ is the world’s newest nation and was founded in the heart of Seattle by colonists who ripped away land from the local population. CHAZ was founded on very noble causes. But not so noble was the fact that the moment the nation was formed - a border wall was put up, border patrol guards, a monarch filled the power vacuum etc. 

The root of every country and economy is the government. CHAZ, or CHOP, first identified as an “Autonomous Zone”.  They're modelling the idea of an “Autonomous Zone” coined by Hakim Bey. These autonomous zones can be used as a tactic by anarchists to sneak anarchy into formal society. Or it could be that these dissenters wanted a cool name and just power hungry. 

CHAZ is more of complete chaotic anarchy. Once CHAZ was formed, the Chazians found themselves with a new monarch - a war lord that declared his power, Raz Simone. But Raz isn’t the only one that’s power hungry in CHAZ, as there are other people challenging his rule, leaders trying to organize things in the background.

You know, what do they make, what are they known for, how does this economy make money? We’ll just have to do an estimate. CHAZ strives to be an independent nation with a thriving agricultural industry. Other industries include street markets, bazaars, a very popular street art culture. And of course, you can’t forget about the classic business of extorting local business owners for protection money. Stability is the name of the game. And CHAZ, has none! CHAZ’s economy has one thing that no other nation in the world has - the complete, indisputable support from another gov’t.

Another thing an economy needs is safety. Since CHAZ bans police, they had to build a very elite group of police, medics, and border patrol guards from scratch.  There’s no pesky things like freedom of religion. 

After the recent shootings, the Major claims that they’re gonna take back the police station. If you’re the leaders of CHAZ and you don’t control the violence, if you can’t keep the image of just a peaceful protest - you will be crushed. CHAZ did the smart thing by changing its name from CHAZ, the Capital Hill Autonomous Zone, to CHOP, the Capital Hill “Occupied Protest”. 

Before you start a revolution, make sure you have a detailed plan in place or else things will very quickly descend into chaos

So you need to make money fast in quarantine. But you ran out of options to make money legally. It looks like we’re gonna have to explore more means of business. Becoming a career bank robber is the only logical route.

Robbing banks is like any other business or investment. The more risk you take on, the more money and ROI you’re gonna make. 

You have to keep in mind not to do what’s expected by the public or law enforcement. Study the data on what most would-be bank robbers do on their heists and figure out a way to do the opposite to confuse law enforcement. This is where the money is at.

Partner up with other people. You can rob bigger banks and take home bigger takes. With multiple people, you can instill more fear into the employees and customers. The biggest downside to this is that legitimate partnerships in legal businesses are already risky enough. 

Choose the right bank to rob. If you’re going in blazing, find out what kind of defense measures they have in place like panic buttons, bait money. If you’re gonna do the whole breaking in at night to crack the vault, you’re gonna need to choose a bank that has a security system you pass, a vault you’re able to crack. Whatever bank you choose, you’re gonna want to make sure it has multiple escape routes.

Choose the right getaway car. If everyone invisions the perfect getaway car to be a van or tough looking SUV, use the exact opposite.

Banks and authorities have gotten more and more sophisticated against thieves, just make sure you don’t fall victim for any of these traps. Banks have cash with GPS trackers. Then there’s the classic silent alarm or panic button that tellers can use.

It’s the get rich quick moment we’ve been waiting for. The number one thing you need to do is to instill fear into your subjects.

Once you’re in and out, boom! You just made some instant easy money ;)
But we’re not done yet, so escape in that getaway car and let’s move onto the final step

You have all this heist money that you just scored but before you can use that money, you have to make sure it looks legitimate, whether that be a job, business or investments. This is where money laundering comes in. Once you’ve laundered your score - you’re good to go! Just make sure that if it was a really big score, or any score for that matter, it probably wouldn’t be very wise to make any big purchases right away

You’re Jordan Goudreau a former special forces soldier with a decent history. Your friends had nothing but good stuff to say about you and described you as top of your class. You were a self-proclaimed “freedom fighter”. But like many life-long warfighters, when your time in the military was up, you’re left with the challenge of finding your place in society. That challenge came with troubling money problems.

Fast forward to March 2019, and the US announced that they’re indicting Venezuela’s very sketchy “President”, Nicolás Maduro, along with his cronies on charges of money laundering etc

You had been conveniently awarded a very fat contract to take down Maduro from his arch nemesis, Juan Guaidó. This contract was for a very respectable $1.5m retainer and $213m in future payoffs. A lot of money.

when that deal feel through, this became the get rich quick money making scheme you need.

If you’re gonna overthrow a government, you’re gonna need some help - so it’s time to recruit your all-star team. One of these soldiers that you teamed up with was a guy named Cliver Alcalá. A retired general in the Venezuelan army. He's got a lot of connections, knows the lay of the land, and can give this coup a lot of power behind it.

With you and the general teamed up, it’s time to put together the soldiers. Sketchy general, hungry untrained soldiers, lack of equipment…Not the SEAL Team 6 you were hoping for, but for the money, status, and freedom? We’ll make it work!

Codenamed “Operation Gideon”. Ideally, your invasion would spark a popular rebellion in the locals to help you along the way. Maduro will be in Florida to face prosecution, You’ll get your money to pay off all your debts and to make you a pretty rich man, And you’ll be hailed as the man who single handedly orchestrated the modern day revolution of Venezuela. Reality, however, was different.

Leading up to the invasion, more defectors were being recruited into the camps even if the money and equipment wasn’t arriving, and you were training them. Almost in an instant - the house of cards fell down. But there’s still a silver lining in this mess - the US also just put a $15m bounty on Maduro.

You’re a politician. An idealist looking to make a difference in the world. You‘ve got more ambitious goals of ruling with an iron fist as a dictator or maybe you’re just a powerful businessman looking to protect your interests and investments from the frenzy of the masses. Around the 18th and 19th century, something happened that would change the course of history and your role as a politician forever.

All of a sudden, humanity shifted from power to the state, to power to the people. Rare breeds that understand Crowd Psychology and Mob Mentality win the hearts and minds of the masses. If you want all that power, you better know how to manage crowds.

A psychological crowd is when people are joined together by an idea, a cause, or beliefs. Crowds can be centered around their race, religion, political beliefs, their profession, music tastes, or simply by people identifying as a citizen of the country they’re in. And the moment you join a crowd, you act and think very differently to when you’re alone.

Crowds are rather slow by design because they desperately need a master to guide them - this is where you come in. Just like how people crave to be in crowds, they crave having a charismatic leader to follow through the ends of the Earth. But be warned, just as easily as you can rile up a crowd towards your enemies, another leader can just as easily direct their anger towards you. Whatever kind of crowd it is, the primary job of a leader is to arouse faith in your subjects. Give people something to believe in! With some more caveats. 

If you really want to change the mind of a crowd, to really change their beliefs - to get them to believe that “diamonds are valuable”. And boom - you now know how crowds work, you know about our primitive desire to join crowds or tribes, you know how to avoid the destruction of crowds by not building up any envy with them, and you know how to be that charismatic leader they so desperately crave by boiling down an idea to inspire faith in them, and you know how to inculcate new beliefs in a crowd through repeating an affirmation until it becomes truth and goes viral. Now you can get out there, and start your rule or protect your business interests to make more money.

In light of the mafia trilogy remastered remake, I wanted make a mini-documentary on the founder of organized crime and that made the mafia game possible - Charles Lucky Luciano.

It’s 1931, near the end of the very profitable prohibition era in New York, things are pretty lawless in the criminal underground.

You’re Lucky Luciano, a mobster in New York’s largest Italian gang, headed by, aka “Joe the Boss”. You’re part of the rising second generation of Italian mobsters that spoke English and were raised in America. You didn’t care for silly things. You were an entrepreneur and a Scilian. You saw the opportunity to make even more money by expanding operations into new ventures.

Joe the Boss was against the second biggest Italian borgata, headed by Salvatore Maranzano. He was too power hungry and caught up in his giant ego. And you’ve grown a little disenchanted by all this violence. Even if this war were to end right now, war will certainly break out again in the future. After some murders here & there, you end this war and created The Commission.

This war started when your boss, Giuseppe Joe the Boss Masseria, got the idea that he would be able to declare himself as the boss of bosses, and all the other gangs would just submit to his rule.

Eighteen months later, you finally decided to end it. You went to Maranzano and made a deal behind your bosses back. You’ll get to claim victory and get recognized as the new boss of Joe’s family. Maranzano accepted. And boom - the war was over. Maranzano won and recognized you as the boss.

But Maranzano decided to go back on the deal he made with you by making the same arrogant mistake that Joe the Boss made. Maranzano forced all families into the tight chain of command. He brought all the traditional rules from the Sicilian mafia to America. Maranzano betrayed you. If you don’t act fast, you’ll be lying next to your old boss.

Everyone knew Luciano was practically the Boss of all Bosses. The Five Families slowly but surely DESTROYED their competition. Lucky Luciano became the most powerful mobster in New York.

The rise of the ambitious Luciano gave rise to an prosecutor, named Thomas Dewey. Dewey’s goal was to paint the prostitutes as poor that Lucky took advantage of. Luciano was sentenced to 30-50 years in prison. Once he was out of prison, Dewey got him deported back to Italy and never got to see his beloved home of New York ever again until he died of a heart attack at 64.

A short free mini-documentary on SpaceX ahead of their planned Demo 2 astronaut launch.

You are Elon Musk, the 2001 Elon Musk. You hit it big with PayPal during the Dot Com Boom in Silicon Valley and now are left with all this money lying around. Most people in this situation would probably sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor. But you’re different, you view money as not the endgame, but a tool.

You decided to move to LA. When you visited NASA’s website, there was literally nothing! But you are a smart guy, you come to the conclusion that everything comes down to public support. You gather up a bunch of experts and task them with coming up with some kind of grand spectacle that would reinvigorate people’s spirit to get to Mars again.  

Even though all your friends and family tried to talk you out of your space ambitions so you wouldn’t waste all your money, you and a few friends hop on a flight to Moscow. The Russians were the only ones that could possibly fit your budget. 

You turn around and say “hey guys, I think we can build this rocket ourselves.” But not everyone can afford these expensive launches. If the Russians won’t do it, if the US won’t do it, then it’s up to you to turn interplanetary travel into a reality - and SpaceX was born. After studying rocket science and the space industry for months, Space Exploration Technologies was formed in an old warehouse in LA

You bring your startup know-how of being lean, moving fast, pivoting fast with limited funds, and apply it to the space industry that’s full of these slow-moving bureaucratic behemoths like Lockheed and Boeing.

SpaceX got its first customer, the Department of Defense for a satellite launch. It took an entire year before SpaceX would launch. Employees were trying not to throw up, the fate of your dream of interplanetary travel was on the line.

You finally proved yourself to the world. Both Tesla and SpaceX were so out of money that you had to borrow from friends to make payroll.

Today, things have gone as great. You’ve single-handedly inspired a new generation of people excited to explore the final frontier. You’ve come full circle back to your childhood days of fantasizing about space travel, except now, it’s a one step closer to becoming a reality. Keep an open mind to what’s possible

You turn around and say “hey guys, I think we can build this rocket ourselves.” But not everyone can afford these expensive launches. If the Russians won’t do it, if the US won’t do it, then it’s up to you to turn interplanetary travel into a reality - and SpaceX was born. After studying rocket science and the space industry for months, Space Exploration Technologies was formed in an old warehouse in LA

You bring your startup know-how of being lean, moving fast, pivoting fast with limited funds, and apply it to the space industry that’s full of these slow-moving bureaucratic behemoths like Lockheed and Boeing.

SpaceX got its first customer, the Department of Defense for a satellite launch. It took an entire year before SpaceX would launch. Employees were trying not to throw up, the fate of your dream of interplanetary travel was on the line.

You finally proved yourself to the world. Both Tesla and SpaceX were so out of money that you had to borrow from friends to make payroll.

Today, things have gone as great. You’ve single-handedly inspired a new generation of people excited to explore the final frontier. You’ve come full circle back to your childhood days of fantasizing about space travel, except now, it’s a one step closer to becoming a reality. Keep an open mind to what’s possible

You’re a kid growing up in New York in the lower class and you spend your childhood seeing your parents struggling to make ends meet. You see these local wise guys, mafia members, hanging around your neighborhood. You start to idolize them and come to the conclusion that the working man really is the sucker, something that you vow you’ll never be. You set your mind on becoming a mafioso.

The mafia is a business. A typical business makes money by providing value to the world, by solving customer’s problems. The mafia has an advantage. Instead of making money through providing value, they make money by doing the exact opposite. Out of all the different ways they make money: protection money, infiltrating labor unions, or just some good ol’ fashion robber. Most of them revolve around taking value from people by force.

If you want to be a mafioso and command all the status that you so desperately crave - you have to know your place in the organization. You’re one and only duty is to help. make. the family. Money. You can be an earner or be an enforcer. The mafia that operates outside of the law, they’re gonna need someone to enforce their rules and contracts to make sure they get their money. pick your poison, but if you happen to be one of those rare breeds that is great at both… viscous at the negotiating table.

Just like any other well-oiled organization, the military, corporations, etc, the mob has a very well-defined hierarchy and structure that you need to climb. At the bottom of the pyramid are the Associates. The goal of an Associate is to eventually be initiated into the Mafia as a Made Man, with the next rank being a Soldier. To become an Associate as a teenager is pretty simple, the Mob loves grooming kids from the streets when they’re young. Once you’re an Associate, it’s game time.

Make your bones as the ultimate sign of trust. you have to be sponsored by an existing Made Man. Carry out a hit, that you take the life of another human being in the name of the Family.

Now you’re free to move up the ranks. Your duty is to help with the rackets and find new innovative ways to make money for the family. All the different crews of a family take orders from the next level in the chain of command. You have the Boss - the CEO of the family that has the final say on all decisions. You have the family’s Consigliere, the family’s advisor and the Boss’s right-hand-man who’s usually a trusted friend and confidant.

So you’re the heads of the US. You’ve grown comfortable being the world leader for so long now that you view the US as untouchable, that unlike every other empire in the past, the US empire will never fall. But then comes along China. 

No country in history has ever risen so far, so fast, on so many dimensions of power. that it’s starting to make us feel rather insecure - they’re outshining the master! Worst yet, you’re well aware of what’s called Thucydides Trap. Now, besides the people who profit off of war, no one really wants to go to war - it’s such a hassle. War is our nature. So in times like this, in the name of preparedness, Murphy’s law, just as a thought experiment, let’s say we did need to go to war with China - what would that process look like?

The concept of good fighting evil is so ingrained in us, it’s so primal to us, that if you can activate in people, they’ll go to the ends of the Earth, they’ll do whatever they can to defeat evil. This is the first step in our War Propaganda Machine. They have to believe that they’re the mythological “good guys,” and their fighting to put an end to those evil, barbarian bad guys.

If people believe that war is immoral, and that by going war, they’re immoral, they won’t be able to look at themselves in the mirror and will never support it, so you gotta change this perception by making war look like the most moral, altruistic thing we can do in this situation. But most importantly, you have to frame war as the path to peace - that we need to fight to spread democracy and freedom to these poor people enslaved by the Chinese government.

We need the media to promote our agenda and propaganda while not reporting what we don’t want the public to know about. Sure you’ll have politicians and smaller media outlets here and there that will question the official story, but no one takes them as seriously as a CNN or a New York Times anyways - they’ll be the unpatriotic outsiders. By invoking a sense of good vs evil, by making people feel that they’re on the moral high ground and that the pursuit of peace and democracy justifies war, and by gradually getting that drum beat of battle rising with your pals in the media until that one catalyst event .

-----------------------
The truth about diamonds
You’re Ernest Oppenhiemer in the jewelry business, and you have a monopoly over all the diamond mines in South Africa, the biggest diamond producer
De Beers was on top of the world
Diamonds make for great jewelry that the world is willing to top dollar for, they have industrial uses that no other materials can really replace, and you control the main area in the world where 90% diamonds are coming from
Everyone thought that diamonds are pretty rare, making them very valuable much like how gold is valuable
It’s becoming more apparent that diamonds aren’t really as rare as we thought
The economics of diamonds are looking pretty bleak, but you’re a very clever businessman so you’re not willing to quit
Shift your business from digging as many diamonds out of the ground as possible, to doing everything in your power to control how many diamonds come out of the ground
Turn your modest diamond operation into the most successful monopoly cartel the world has ever seen in the blood diamond trade

A cartel is a group of companies coming together to fix the price of a product so that the all cartel members get their fair share of the profits
Like how major oil countries come together as the cartel OPEC, to fix the price of crude oil, except with a diamond cartel
Once these locals catch on to how profitable the diamond trade is, they’ll started trading diamonds and smuggling it - do whatever is necessary to crush them

Now that you have the start of the supply chain under your grip, it’s time for  the merchants
Since you control 90% of the world’s diamond output, merchants who want to buy raw diamonds can really only go to you
You can’t legally operate in the US, so set up shop in London where you’ll distribute raw diamonds to merchants
It’s the 1930’s, you’re making more money than ever but the people in you’re biggest market, the US, don’t really care about diamonds and your sales were pretty small
But jewelery is just that, a “nice-to-have,” a luxury that only people with extra money can afford
You need diamonds to symbolize something so evergreen that no matter how the economy was doing, no matter how rich or poor a person was, people would always need diamonds

-----------------------
The truth about diamonds
You’re Ernest Oppenhiemer in the jewelry business, and you have a monopoly over all the diamond mines in South Africa, the biggest diamond producer
De Beers was on top of the world
Diamonds make for great jewelry that the world is willing to top dollar for, they have industrial uses that no other materials can really replace, and you control the main area in the world where 90% diamonds are coming from
Everyone thought that diamonds are pretty rare, making them very valuable much like how gold is valuable
It’s becoming more apparent that diamonds aren’t really as rare as we thought
The economics of diamonds are looking pretty bleak, but you’re a very clever businessman so you’re not willing to quit
Shift your business from digging as many diamonds out of the ground as possible, to doing everything in your power to control how many diamonds come out of the ground
Turn your modest diamond operation into the most successful monopoly cartel the world has ever seen in the blood diamond trade

A cartel is a group of companies coming together to fix the price of a product so that the all cartel members get their fair share of the profits
Like how major oil countries come together as the cartel OPEC, to fix the price of crude oil, except with a diamond cartel
Once these locals catch on to how profitable the diamond trade is, they’ll started trading diamonds and smuggling it - do whatever is necessary to crush them

Now that you have the start of the supply chain under your grip, it’s time for  the merchants
Since you control 90% of the world’s diamond output, merchants who want to buy raw diamonds can really only go to you
You can’t legally operate in the US, so set up shop in London where you’ll distribute raw diamonds to merchants
It’s the 1930’s, you’re making more money than ever but the people in you’re biggest market, the US, don’t really care about diamonds and your sales were pretty small
But jewelery is just that, a “nice-to-have,” a luxury that only people with extra money can afford
You need diamonds to symbolize something so evergreen that no matter how the economy was doing, no matter how rich or poor a person was, people would always need diamonds

So you’re China
You have the ambitions to take over the world and your economy is growing fast
One way you’re funding your goal is with your Belt and Road Initiative, or one belt one road, a plan to make it easier for anyone to trade with China. Another is Made in China 2025
Your energy demands for electricity, oil, etc, are higher than ever and it’s gonna keep growing 
The original Silk Road that connected China to the rest of the world runs through an area of China called Xinjiang.
Xinjiang is also home to a ton of natural resources.
It has 40% of your coal reserves, 25% of your gas reserves, so Xinjiang is your most important piece of land
Xinjiang is home to the Uighurs
If Uighurs don’t feel like they’re a part of the Chinese culture, they could want to form their own independent nation
If you don’t do something about this issue, everything falls apart

You need to flood the city with police and 24 hour surveillance to keep the peace. So you turn Xinjiang into a high tech police state to categorize people as safe, regular, or unsafe

So you build re-education camps
This is gonna cost a lot of money to build and maintain but the ROI of tightening our grip on this region will be make us a lot more money 
While you have all these people captured, you might as well use them as cheap labor
We can’t afford to lose any business so once word does get out, you gotta suck up your pride and control the narrative

-----------------------
It’s the early 1900’s, career politicians are in a pickle 
You want more money from the subjects you rule over. You know how to spend their money better than they do, their money is better off in your hands.
You want more money for troubling times, when everyone was too irresponsible to prepare
They’ll instinctually look to the government for help. If you don’t offer any welfare, they’ll blame on you
But if you had money on your hands, you'll have the ability to give them some welfare, stimulus checks, unemployment insurance and benefits, some grants
The main way to make money is from taxes, but can't tax too much
If you could print free money, you'd get the same result as taxing. 
The idea of the gov printing as much money as they want just doesn't sound right and reminds people of hyperinflation in places like Germany, Venezuela, Zimbabwe
Enter - the Federal Reserve - America’s money printer

The Panic of 1907 happened: stock market dropped almost 50%, there were bank runs, banks and small and large businesses declared bankruptcy

In 1910, you go to Jekyll Island with your five guests
Assistant secretary of the US treasury Heads of the most powerful banks at the time, National City Bank of New York, JP Morgan, and Kuhn, Loeb & Company

Big bankers:
Small banks were popping up all over, the big banks in New York were losing of market share to competition
Interest rates at the time were set by the free market, which meant less profits
To make more money as a bank, more risk, lend out more of your depositors’ money, but you didn’t have gov bailouts and stimulus packages
The Federal Reserve system was born

You can’t just say “We’re gonna print $2 trillion dollars today!”
Calling it something more technical: 
Discount Window, Open Market Operations, changing the reserve ratio, Quantitative Easing
Anything that doesn’t allude to “We’re inflating the money supply & making your money less valuable”

Gov Debt: the gov takes out loans as treasury notes or bonds
This debt forms the foundation for nearly all of the nation’s money supply

Let’s say you’re a political leader or an aspiring one of a country and you want more power
Because with more power, comes more money, more business
You want to bring back the good ol’ days of kings and queens and royalty
So we need to learn how to maneuver around the population
And what better example to learn how to master this skill than from the world’s second greatest economy - China

The enemy of the government is information
If you control the flow of information, you control the population
Controlling the internet is so important to China that they have an entire division of the government dedicated to it and have an entire industry that’s booming financially
Allow people to criticise the gov to give them the illusion of free speech, but don’t let them mobilize
Use the very clever Chinese tactic of flooding
Instead of outright censoring websites, use people’s impatience to your advantage

If you’re a US company and you want access to China’s 1.4 billion people to sell and market to, you have to kiss the ring
China offers Chinese tech startups the incentive of less competition
It’s citizens are put in a similar position. Things could be better, but our GDP per Capita, average income, and our overall quality of life has improved so much
We’re here to build an empire of subservient subjects - it will take some time

The culture of a society is the root of everything
It’s not the laws and institutions that influence the crowd, it’s the crowd’s culture that allows for the laws to be passed and for the institutions to act as they do
This is the hardest part of the equation bc changing a culture takes time
Luckily for China, their culture has already been rooted in the family instead of the individual for generations
If you’re able to solve this problem of culture, everything will fall into place with much less friction bc all the powers, censorship, surveillance, leverage, and puppet strings will just be an inevitable downstream of the culture you created

The business of Elon Musk's SpaceX has always been to make humanity an interplanetary species
Although SpaceX has made more progress than practically all government space agencies, combined unless Elon figures out a way to speed up the rate of innovation he’s gonna be dead by the time we land on Mars.

The biggest thing standing in the way of SpaceX right now is money
Their entire business model is centered around launching payloads into space, according to Elon, taps out at around $3b per year
Far from Elon’s estimated $100b to $10t that’s needed to build a city on Mars

So Elon needs some kind of cash cow, some kind of side business that will provide the kind of money needed to fund their main goal - third world internet and Starlink
An untapped industry and business idea that Elon estimates could bring in roughly $30-50 billion dollars in revenue per year.

The internet is the most impactful inventions of all time. But by 2018, half of the humanity’s population, around 3.4 billion people at the time, still have not experienced the golden age of information

That’s where Starlink comes in. And with this system alone, Starlink could single handily bring half of the world into the modern economy

People that live away from major metropolitan areas can afford fast internet, but they’re the hardest for telecom companies to reach. Before Starlink is able to serve the ones that need internet most, it has to not go bankrupt

By 1997, owning a computer went from a far off luxury to a necessity and the Age of Information was born with plenty of money to follow.
If Starlink is successful, wnot only will Elon be able to get to Mars faster, but he will have inadvertently created a similar boom
3.75b more people with money to spend online
Double the people to serve ads to
Double the people that will want an online education
Double the people on YouTube

That’s where Starlink comes in. And with this system alone, Starlink could single handily bring half of the world into the modern economy

People that live away from major metropolitan areas can afford fast internet, but they’re the hardest for telecom companies to reach. Before Starlink is able to serve the ones that need internet most, it has to not go bankrupt

By 1997, owning a computer went from a far off luxury to a necessity and the Age of Information was born with plenty of money to follow.
If Starlink is successful, wnot only will Elon be able to get to Mars faster, but he will have inadvertently created a similar boom
3.75b more people with money to spend online
Double the people to serve ads to
Double the people that will want an online education
Double the people on YouTube

You’ve got some good underground business ventures going on
You’re a professional who’s only loyal to one thing - the holy dollar. 
You’ve got some businesses on your hands that are doing really well, now you’re drowning in cash.

Unless you can show that all that money came from a legitimate source like a regular business,  then you are screwed
If you use this dirty money to fund your lavish lifestyle,  eventually, you’ll catch the attention of those gov agencies like the FBI, IRS, DEA 

We need a way to clean that money, to disguise the nefarious origins of how we earned the money, so that we can spend it on real estate, legitimate businesses, the lavish lifestyle that you rightfully deserve
We need to learn the game of one of the biggest industries in the world - the business of money laundering
Money laundering is the life blood to our profession of organized
cleaning the money you got from your enterprise was easy
But today, it’s different - law enforcement has realized how vital money laundering is to us
They’re a lot stricter with banks, they’ve made it so that any business dealing in cash has to report transactions over $10,000, and they use algorithms to catch on to suspicious transactions
Like any other profession or industry, as the landscape evolves, so do the tactics
But the fundamentals of how to launder money are still the same
1. Conceal the ownership and source of the money
2. Change the money’s form
3. Obscure the financial trail
4. Complete control over the process and the people to prevent skimming

Step 1: Get the dirty money into the banking system
One popular way to go about doing this is by using legitimate businesses as fronts for your laundering
Buy a restaurant, bar, retail store, or any other business that deals in a lot of cash, and carefully inject a little extra cash into the business’s books every day

Step 2: After dirty money is brought into the financial system, it’s time to hose off all that dirt
Set up a bunch of dummy shell companies around the world in areas where the economy is stable, and they don’t enforce money laundering as heavily
Send the money around the world to as many different accounts

Step 3: Withdraw the newly washed money from your accounts back into circulation as sweet, taxable, and most importantly, legal income, that you can spend on whatever
No one will be able to trace the money back to you

With the 2020 election coming up, it's a good time to learn how to make money as a politician
Back in the good ol days, if you were a politician, and you wanted to make extra money on the side thanks to the powerful position you’re in - it was pretty simple
You’d take bribes, and stuff the $90,000 into your freezer
You’d do some insider trading
You cut to the chase and make it easy for your customers, like Former Congressman Duke Cunningham did, with his innovative bribe menu
Want a $16m defense contract? That will be $140,000 and a luxury yacht

But today only around 17% of people actually trusting the government, directly taking bribes just don’t work anymore
Who cares about a few thousand dollars? You’re a selfless public servant. You deserve more.
We need a new way to take bribes, a new way to get insider deals, without alerting the public and directly breaking any laws

As a politician, you’re in the business of selling influence to those looking to buy political favors, exceptions, insider deals; and your customers whether that be a local company, or a foreign corporation or government, pays in the form of bribes
Once the public did catch on, they put together disclosure laws 
If the money you’re directly getting is legal, it’s probably best to avoid any suspicious transactions at all cost bc why draw attention to yourself
There’s a simple solution to this that does require more work, but it’s absolutely worth it bc we’re able to move hundreds of millions of dollars at a time, sometimes billions of dollars
We just need to borrow a simple concept from the business world called offshoring
As the economy becomes more global, companies use offshoring to maximize their profits
Some offshoring is legitimate, but some companies do it to obscure their transactions
So we offshore our corruption
Instead of us doing the questionable deal we move the deal and the people involved out of the country to places where there are far less disclosure laws or have our kids or close friends do the deal.

Back in the old days, if you were an entrepreneur that managed to make it big, and built yourself a nice giant successful business, you were on top of the world
But you’re ambitious - you want more - more money, more profits
But putting more money into R&D, into building a better product will only get you so far
You turn to selling your products for a loss, buying up your competitors, buying up other businesses in your product’s supply chain, and other monopolistic practices
With those pesky antitrust laws, that’s just not an option anymore, you might have to keep innovating to stay alive
Instead of working harder, providing a better service, and innovating to grow and stay afloat, we could have the government crush our competitors for us?
“Well gee, Jake. That sounds all good but how would anyone be okay with giving the government that much power to make the lives of big businesses easier?”
Instead of proclaiming to everyone our monopolistic intentions, we just say that it’s in the “public’s best interest”
We tell the world and congress that we need gov to protect consumers from greedy, unsafe businesses
We need to learn the game of crony capitalism

In 1998 Microsoft was the biggest company in the world, the most innovative companies in the world
Microsoft and Bill Gates thought that “business is going great, our customers love our products”
They spent zero dollars on lobbying or cronyism
When politicians kept seeing just how much money Microsoft was making Bill Gates is called into the Senate
And six months later, Microsoft got another knock on the door from the Justice Department
Microsoft was found guilty for giving away a product for free and spent the next nearly 10 years fighting that case, devoting time, resources, and lots of money to it
If you're making money and you don’t pander to the politicians, they'll come to your door, so why not profit from it too?

The other big tech companies have learned from Microsoft’s mistakes and now take a more offensive approach
Amazon was facing a lot of bad press about their low minimum wage, so Jeff Bezos raised the minimum wage to $15 for all Amazon workers and announced that he’ll be lobbying Congress to increase the minimum wage
AKA, he's gently bribing politicians to allow the  government to force his competitors expenses up

Back in the old days, if you were an entrepreneur that managed to make it big, and built yourself a nice giant successful business, you were on top of the world
But you’re ambitious - you want more - more money, more profits
But putting more money into R&D, into building a better product will only get you so far
You turn to selling your products for a loss, buying up your competitors, buying up other businesses in your product’s supply chain, and other monopolistic practices
With those pesky antitrust laws, that’s just not an option anymore, you might have to keep innovating to stay alive
Instead of working harder, providing a better service, and innovating to grow and stay afloat, we could have the government crush our competitors for us?
“Well gee, Jake. That sounds all good but how would anyone be okay with giving the government that much power to make the lives of big businesses easier?”
Instead of proclaiming to everyone our monopolistic intentions, we just say that it’s in the “public’s best interest”
We tell the world and congress that we need gov to protect consumers from greedy, unsafe businesses
We need to learn the game of crony capitalism

In 1998 Microsoft was the biggest company in the world, the most innovative companies in the world
Microsoft and Bill Gates thought that “business is going great, our customers love our products”
They spent zero dollars on lobbying or cronyism
When politicians kept seeing just how much money Microsoft was making Bill Gates is called into the Senate
And six months later, Microsoft got another knock on the door from the Justice Department
Microsoft was found guilty for giving away a product for free and spent the next nearly 10 years fighting that case, devoting time, resources, and lots of money to it
If you're making money and you don’t pander to the politicians, they'll come to your door, so why not profit from it too?

The other big tech companies have learned from Microsoft’s mistakes and now take a more offensive approach
Amazon was facing a lot of bad press about their low minimum wage, so Jeff Bezos raised the minimum wage to $15 for all Amazon workers and announced that he’ll be lobbying Congress to increase the minimum wage
AKA, he's gently bribing politicians to allow the  government to force his competitors expenses up

Drug cartels are a lot like Walmart
The biggest complaint about Walmart is that they’re kinda like a monopoly. They’re able dictate how much they’re willing to pay suppliers for their products because they’re the biggest buyer. Instead of Walmart being a monopoly, it’s a monopsony. 

Drug cartels have the same advantage
Most of them don’t grow their own drugs, they buy drugs from ordinary poor farmers, that are just trying to make a living
Then they package it up and handle all the distribution to consumers. They’re able to keep their costs down even when the farmer’s costs go up

Most retail businesses sell their products with around a 10 to 100% markup from the wholesale price
Markups in the drug business are a little bit more steep than that
Instead of a 10-100% markup, going from $385 to $122,000 is more like a 30,000% markup

But it’s still pretty profitable because drugs are kinda like the marketeer’s dream
Since man started selling products, they’ve devised better and better ways to make their products more addictive. But drugs are as addictive as it gets!

The drug trade is the ultimate form of entrepreneurship
Instead of a traditional market where anyone can easily set up shop, the drug trade is a network market, where a big part of your success is from the connections you have. How good are you at managing relationships? 

With all this money on the line, drug traffickers have tried nearly every idea, so what innovation can you bring to the table

“an organization’s people are its most valuable asset” If you want to build a drug cartel empire, then you’re gonna need people. You have to recruit these people in secrecy, without job postings, whiling making sure they’re not undercover cops, informants. If you’re in policed countries like the US or UK, another great option is to use independent contractors

This is the Czinger 21C. The unique part is that the 21C’s frame is made up of a lattice of 3D printed aluminum nodes connected together with carbon fiber poles. It represents the slow shift from  traditional manufacturing to digitizing manufacturing into software

It represents the start of the 3D Printing Industrial Revolution

Meet Relativity Space, a startup cofounded by previous SpaceX and Blue Origin employees, they’re working on bringing 3D printing to disrupt aerospace engineering

Backed by big investors like Mark Cuban and Y Combinator, and partnered with giants like the US Air Force and NASA, they’ve created the world’s largest 3D printer to build rockets

Relativity retrofitted a giant robot arm to feed in aluminum wire and melt it on the spot with a powerful laser

SpaceX have already integrated 3D printing in their Dragon spacecraft via their SuperDraco Engines, in which the combustion chambers are fully 3D printed

Another startup called Launcher has a focus in helping the small satellite market launch more affordably with their 3D printed copper rocket engines

Back in Tabasco, Mexico, 3D printing is also hitting closer to home

Tabasco is home to some of the lowest income families in Mexico. This is the site that the startup, Icon, chose to create the world’s first 3D printed housing community. Thanks to their new Vulcan II concrete home 3d printer. The printer itself can build up to 2,000 sq ft in virtually any floorplan faster, with less waste, and at around half of the cost of traditional homebuilding. Icon’s 3D printed homes aren’t just for people living in absolute poverty

Desktop Metal have created a software that uses algorithms to generate the most efficient, strongest design, using the least amount of material

The biggest thing holding 3D printing back is still costs. Traditional mass production as you produce more goods the cost continues to drop - economies of scale.

-----------------------
Back in the good old days, if you were an empire builder, you’d just round up the troops and invade where-ever you please.

But that came with a myriad of problems
The plebs in the country you’re invading would retaliate and not comply
Today, other global superpowers like Russia could rebel to protect their allies
You’d build animosity with everyone you ruled over 
Invading countries you want to capture isn’t a good public relations move

In today’s world, we needed a different strategy where’d we get the same outcome: control over another country to expand our empire, make more money, get access to their natural resources, etc
But without all the negatives that come with an all out invasion.

Enter - debt

Debt is the most subtle and effective form of imperialism the world has ever known
Let’s say you’ve got a huge construction company or engineering company that specializes in massive power plants, hydroelectric plants, civil engineering infrastructure
Or you’re a powerful politician with a stake in big private companies like these

You all want the same thing - more money.

But there are only so many giant new infrastructure projects first world countries need
So if you can’t get new business domestically, how are you suppose to grow your business and profits?
Third world countries

it’s pretty easy to justify that, “hey, if we build this stuff for you, your people and your economy would be a lot better off and would love you for it”

You almost have a multi-billion dollar strategy - but we’re not quite there yet
They don’t have much money to pay you for these expensive projects

That's where the magic of debt in the form of foreign aid comes in
Countries that previously couldn’t afford your services, all of a sudden can
Even if just one of these projects goes through banks approving a giant loan, that’s a good few billion dollars

As a politician, the more entrenched a country is in your debt, the more power and money you have

These people’s jobs are to study the economy of the nation and make economic projections and studies of where the country might be in 10, 20 years if they had a shiny new hydroelectric plant built

On the Fall of 2015, two Silicon Valley veterans that both have poor eyesight formed a secretive startup

And as the years went by, they recruited talent from Apple, Amazon, HP, Google and much more “to invent something that had never been built before, using technology that was said to have to be ‘called in from the future.’”

Fast forward to January 2020, and Mojo, a startup with over $100m in funding, with the world’s first augmented reality contact lens, as a new player in the Trillion Dollar Cyborg Revolution

AR has been around for a while now so it’s not anything special
We’ve seen things like Google Glass that can be extremely useful, but AR has never really taken off

They’ve created the world’s first real smart contact lenses that’s able to display useful heads up information onto your vision. They’re calling this new form of tech, Invisible Computing

Their focus is helping people with different vision impairments see better

With something like Mojo or other startups, you can imagine that humanity’s future will probably look a lot clearer

In the future, their goal is to also make the lives of consumers and workers a little bit easier

Humans have different levels of needs that need to be fulfilled in a certain order, and every business works within these different levels

Physiological needs, safety, love, esteem, and self-actualization AKA Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

In business, the lower on that hierarchy of needs that you’re serving to your customers, the more evergreen your industry is gonna be

During a recession or a depression, people aren't gonna waste their money on needless stuff

📰 Sources & visuals // https://www.jaketran.io/blog/metadata-preacher-profiteers-how-to-start-a-mega-church

What if I told you that you could start a business that 
Was except from paying any federal, state, local, or property taxes
Your customers treated you like holy divinity and shower you with cash every time you walk into the room
Your customers will willingly pay for you to live in multi-million dollar homes tax free
And you’re in a position where you’re able to openly ask your customers to pay for $54 million private jets
Well get your bibles out, loosen up those morals, bc this is how to be a preacher profiteer

The Business of Religion

Being a Preacher Profiteer is just like any other business - it helps if you understand your customers and your market
And much like the business of war, the business of religion is as primal. as. it. Gets.
Since the days of our ancestors fearing mother nature - fearing and believing a higher power or divinity has been a part of what makes humans, human.
And as the famous historian and philosopher Will Durant puts it, religion “gives man a belief that will enable him to tolerate life”

THIS. Is the business we’re in. We’re not selling sermons, We’re not selling church choirs
No, no, no. We’re in the business of selling hope. Selling salvation. Selling community. Selling the ability to tolerate the difficulties of life.
And when you’re viewed as the benevolent authority on hope, the afterlife, salvation, you’re customers are gonna take you pretty seriously.

Ihe direr the need, the more people are willing to pay.
You may not be willing to pay $850,000 for a glorified watch…
But what about for a cancer treatment?

That’s the power of religion.
Not only is it so deep in the human condition, but you get to sell to society’s most vulnerable people with the most dire needs.

But the benefits don’t stop there, because you’re protected by the government
For all the other plebs out there, the IRS may seem like your worst enemy, but to churches, they’re your guardian angel

That means, like we mentioned earlier, the business of religion puts the greatest tax havens on Earth like the Cayman Islands, to shame. You don’t have to worry about that pesty FTC looking into your sketchy business practices.

What if I told you that you could start a business that 
Was except from paying any federal, state, local, or property taxes
Your customers treated you like holy divinity and shower you with cash every time you walk into the room
Your customers will willingly pay for you to live in multi-million dollar homes tax free
And you’re in a position where you’re able to openly ask your customers to pay for $54 million private jets
Well get your bibles out, loosen up those morals, bc this is how to be a preacher profiteer

The Business of Religion

Being a Preacher Profiteer is just like any other business - it helps if you understand your customers and your market
And much like the business of war, the business of religion is as primal. as. it. Gets.
Since the days of our ancestors fearing mother nature - fearing and believing a higher power or divinity has been a part of what makes humans, human.
And as the famous historian and philosopher Will Durant puts it, religion “gives man a belief that will enable him to tolerate life”

THIS. Is the business we’re in. We’re not selling sermons, We’re not selling church choirs
No, no, no. We’re in the business of selling hope. Selling salvation. Selling community. Selling the ability to tolerate the difficulties of life.
And when you’re viewed as the benevolent authority on hope, the afterlife, salvation, you’re customers are gonna take you pretty seriously.

Ihe direr the need, the more people are willing to pay.
You may not be willing to pay $850,000 for a glorified watch…
But what about for a cancer treatment?

That’s the power of religion.
Not only is it so deep in the human condition, but you get to sell to society’s most vulnerable people with the most dire needs.

But the benefits don’t stop there, because you’re protected by the government
For all the other plebs out there, the IRS may seem like your worst enemy, but to churches, they’re your guardian angel

That means, like we mentioned earlier, the business of religion puts the greatest tax havens on Earth like the Cayman Islands, to shame. You don’t have to worry about that pesty FTC looking into your sketchy business practices.

If this escalates to another major war in the middle east or hell, maybe even WWIII, theres a lot of money to be made

At the height of the Iraq invasion starting in 2003, the US had around 150,000 soldiers deployed.

The US government has to outfit all these soldiers with $17,500 of equipment each + all the logistical costs: food, housing, water, plumbing, transportation

The gov doesn’t manufacture or provide any of this stuff. So that means at some point in the process, these products and services have to exchange hands with every day citizens like you and I.

And the way the government lets citizens and companies provide these products and services is through US government contracts.

The US spent nearly $5 trillion dollars on the war. All that money had to go to somebody.

You have the giant companies that secure the big defense contracts like Boeing, Lockheed, Halliburton. But when the US needs small orders, these big businesses can't fullfill them

Why waste your time for a few thousand to a few million in profit when you can build entire military bases for billions of dollars?

And for two young entrepreneurs David and Efraim, that is what they took advantage of.

When there are gov contracts that the big boys deem too small and not worth their time, we pick up their scraps, offer a competitive bid, fulfill the contract at all costs, and make a profit. 

And within their first year of business, they landed over 100 US contracts which totaled up to over $10 million dollars. Then they landed a giant $298 million dollar contract.

Depending on which study you read, in the next few decades, humanity will reach the singularity. The point at which computers will match or exceed human intelligence.

If you think about it, all humanity has ever achieved has been because of 3 factors: how much information we can take in, how much information we can process, and how much information we can put out.

Every problem we haven’t solved yet - curing cancer, going to mars, all comes back to how fast, or how slow, we can interact or interface with the world around us

The real bottleneck are the first and last factors

Compare that to artificial intelligence - when it reaches its singularity point, it will be able to think like us and process info like us, except it won’t have the bottleneck of physical bodies.

Humanity’s “interface” with the world, our senses and physical bodies have very “low bandwidth” as Elon Musk likes to call it

In 2017, Elon Musk launched a secretive startup called Neuralink.

Neuralink’s long term goal is to free humanity from this bottleneck by bypassing our archaic limbs altogether, and augment that connection between our brains and the outside world with a computer chip that connects the two together. AKA cyborgs with what’s called Brain-Machine Interface devices or BMI’s

Once you have the BMI installed, it would connect wirelessly to an outside wearable so you don’t have wires sticking out of your head and to a smartphone app

With something like this, as the technology progresses, Neuralink offer us, not just a way out, but a way in to ride the wave of real Ai, instead of being crushed by Skynet

A lot of people talk about how revolutionary Ai is, blockchain, even me with quantum computing
But if you think about it - all those innovations operate outside of humans, it’s just another tool we interact with

There’s something special about war.

Over the past 3,400 years of human history, we’ve spent only 268 of them in peace

But the business of war goes much further back than that, with the first one ever recorded in 2700 BCE in Mesopotamia

This makes the industry of war have a longer track record than the information industry, education, and banking combined

War is the ultimate discipline of any government. War is to government what life and death is to humans. If nations can meet the challenge of war, they’ll survive. If it can’t, they’ll perish.

War can also be looked at as a racket.

If you can help governments in their primal act of survival to remain in power by offering raw materials, weapons, soldiers, services to soldiers; you’re gonna be the government’s best friend.

Normal business profit margins are around 10%, give or take. 
But war-time profits? We’re talking 20%, 60%, 100%, 300%, 800%, the sky is the limit!

DuPont for example during WWI, during the war-time years, their profits increased by more than 950%!
Or take the Central Leather Company at that time, in the three years before the war, profits were around $3.5m. In 1916? $15m.

During the Iraq War, often called the most privatized war in history; KBR, the main logistics supplier contractor for the US, we’re talking food, facilities, etc., got a whopping $39.5b in Iraq-related contracts

KBR’s parent company, Halliburton’s CEO was paid $42.6m in 2004
CACI’s CEO made a fairly decent $22.2m in 2004
TITAN? He takes the crown with a $47.2m income in 2004 and 5

If you look throughout history - funding and supplying the enemy is all in a days work as a War Profiteer

In the War Industry: your customers are all the governments of the world.

You can’t make war-time profits... if there isn’t a war.

The general public usually never wants to go to war

Now is the time to lobby for war, push for more conflicts, max out your campaign contributions, get the media involved

The Limits of Humanity

In 1956, to store 5MB of data, you needed a hard drive the size of an XL refrigerator. Today, we can hold over 51,000x on the tip of our finger

But we kept getting diminishing returns within the last few years.

Computers are still getting faster but we’re not seeing the exponential strides we had

The one technology that powers our entire modern day lives, that is at the core of every millionaire dollar business, every billion dollar business, brick and motor business, education, government is at a plateau.

And the person that can figure out a new way to keep pushing humanity forward? Forget millionaire, forget billionaire. They’ll be one of the most pivotal people in all of human history.

The Quantum Computing Advantage

Instead of just bits only representing 0 and 1's or just 2 states, thanks to quantum physics, each bit in a quantum computer or qubit can represent 0 or 1 at the same time

More possible states = more possible data that can be processed at the same time

This allows quantum computers to scale up exponentially faster

AI is the perfect candidate for the power of quantum computing

Another use case is using quantum in the financial markets, stock market, etc, to predict where prices will go

Cryptography is another industry that is going to be heavily disrupted

Others include:
Weather Forecasting
Molecular Modeling
Particle Physics

This short little clip from the richest man in the world, founder and CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, emcompasses every reason why dropshipping won’t last

Dropshipping was one of the latest… we’ll call it “business out of a box” schemes that has been around for a few years now

This is where internet marketers claim that if you buy their course, they’ll teach you how with very little effort, you can make money, quit your job, buy a lambo, without much effort

There are many forms of it: ebay dropshipping, amazon dropshipping, print on demand, etc.

The whole premise is that you can find these so-called “winning products” from wholesale distributors, usually from China with Aliexpress

You find the winning product
You get traffic to your website via paid ads on Facebook and Instagram
People buy
You pocket the difference - aka retail arbitrage


When you get paid at a job, you made money because you provided value to your employer in the form of your labor.

And in every other business it’s the exact same - you make money from customers when you provide enough value to them

The more value, the more money you make

So money is really just a storehouse of value

In Jeff’s own words, customers that buy products online only care about these three things: low prices, big selection, fast delivery

And since that’s literally all Amazon focuses on, that’s probably why Jeff is the richest man in the world 

Yet, what are the only things people and online gurus focus with dropshipping?
How I can do the least amount of work

This short little clip from the richest man in the world, founder and CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, emcompasses every reason why dropshipping won’t last

Dropshipping was one of the latest… we’ll call it “business out of a box” schemes that has been around for a few years now

This is where internet marketers claim that if you buy their course, they’ll teach you how with very little effort, you can make money, quit your job, buy a lambo, without much effort

There are many forms of it: ebay dropshipping, amazon dropshipping, print on demand, etc.

The whole premise is that you can find these so-called “winning products” from wholesale distributors, usually from China with Aliexpress

You find the winning product
You get traffic to your website via paid ads on Facebook and Instagram
People buy
You pocket the difference - aka retail arbitrage


When you get paid at a job, you made money because you provided value to your employer in the form of your labor.

And in every other business it’s the exact same - you make money from customers when you provide enough value to them

The more value, the more money you make

So money is really just a storehouse of value

In Jeff’s own words, customers that buy products online only care about these three things: low prices, big selection, fast delivery

And since that’s literally all Amazon focuses on, that’s probably why Jeff is the richest man in the world 

Yet, what are the only things people and online gurus focus with dropshipping?
How I can do the least amount of work

Contrary to popular belief, most people in the middle class and even in the lower class will have earned more than $1m in their lifetime

But getting to a million dollars in net worth by age 26 when most people have barely gotten out of school? That’s pretty impressive.

Today, he has an estimated net worth of is anywhere from $3m-$5m

this is how Graham Stephan became a millionaire by age 26, aka the $5m Dollar Millennial

Real estate - the path that Graham chose to make his millions - via real estate investing

where businesses come and go on what seems like a daily basis these days, no matter what happens, people will always need a place to live

By 2011, the stock market had already crashed 3 years earlier and was on the way back up, but real estate on the other hand was still crashing

He knew these prices were just too good to pass up

At 21, Graham bought his first rental property for a mere $60,000 in cash and was now a real estate investor

He was making around $1,200 passively every single month just from the tenant paying rent

Not too long after, he got two more properties.

And after buying property #4 in 2016 in West LA, and property #5 a duplex 2 years ago in 2017, and property #6 another duplex a year ago in 2018, that brings him to today with an estimated net worth of around $5m with roughly $4,800 in cashflow every single month

Why RE?

Appreciation

Since the population keeps growing and demand keeps growing, real estate typically goes up in value over time

Leverage

Because homes are usually a pretty safe bet, this makes it easier to borrow money (mortgage) to buy a house

Tenants pays off your loan for you

Not only are you safely leveraging you money to make more money - someone is basically paying you to own a house

Cashflow

if Graham hadn’t already learned how to save money and make money leading up to that opportunity, he would NOT be a millionaire today

Doug Demuro should NOT have over 3m subs

Yet… Somehow, in this world of helicopter shots, race track footage, flexing in Beverly Hills; this quirky, middle age dude has literally become, hands down, my all time favorite car YouTuber that I trust more than anyone else

I wouldn’t consider myself a car nut and I’m willing to bet that you’re the same

No, all you care about is what the car looks like, how exhilarating is it to drive, how valuable the car is, and most importantly, how it would feel to own the car and use it as a daily driver or as just a fun a weekend car
And notice that with all the things I just mentioned that the average person cares about… none of them relate to the technical aspects of the car

Or in other words, the general public doesn’t care about any of that stuff, all they care about is how the car would make them feel

https://youtu.be/W660B4eQsSU?t=622 
So it’s no wonder that Doug doesn’t really talk about any of the technical specs of the cars he reviews

Sure he mentions basic stuff like how powerful the engine is but his entire videos are all centered around what the general public cares about - how the cars would make them feel

Where big name channels with movie level production quality can only capture a the smaller audience of gearheads, Doug captures of the general public, and thus gets more views, more support, and more success

He appeals to a bigger general audience by understanding exactly what they want.

Now objectively, one would think the big production companies and the rich guys flexing their wealth would win over someone like Doug - but it’s actually the main reason they’re losing to him

It’s not just bc he appeals and understands the general audience

He’s successful largely bc of his unique personality

You don’t click on a Doug video just bc it’s about a Lamborghini or a Ferrari - after all, there’s a surplus of videos on these cars already
No, you click on a Doug video bc it's Doug

Where others focus on things only a small percentage of people who are into cars care about, he cuts all the fluff and focuses only on the one thing that people do care about - how the cars would make them feel
And because of this, his audience pool is much bigger

But catering to the right audience isn’t enough - when everyone is making the same videos on the same cars, you need something more

He’s successful largely bc of his unique personality

You don’t click on a Doug video just bc it’s about a Lamborghini or a Ferrari - after all, there’s a surplus of videos on these cars already
No, you click on a Doug video bc it's Doug

Where others focus on things only a small percentage of people who are into cars care about, he cuts all the fluff and focuses only on the one thing that people do care about - how the cars would make them feel
And because of this, his audience pool is much bigger

But catering to the right audience isn’t enough - when everyone is making the same videos on the same cars, you need something more

Banks are not only able to print money, but they’re actually encouraged by the government to do so

Banking is one of the least understood businesses throughout history, and yet, they are the very places that people dump their life savings into

So how does the business of banking work?

What’s the purpose of a bank?

It’s to have a safe convenient place to store our money

But bankers don’t open up a bank out of the kindness of their hearts to make our lives easier.

The purpose of a bank is to the make the owners money.

But unlike every other business model out there, banks are the only ones that are legally able to print money out of thin air.

Today, it’s a little different because the world doesn’t base it’s money on gold anymore

Fiat money - money that’s really nothing more than paper that the government says is money.

And it’s in this fiat money system that bankers have become the modern day alchemists with the ability to literally create money out of nothing.

You deposit $10,000 into your bank account

Banks are required by law to only keep around 10% of that $10,000 you deposited as “reserves” 

Why would they just let your money sit there when it could be out collecting interest for them and making them money?

So they lent out 90% of your money, or $9,000 as a loan to Frank at a 5% interest rate

All of a sudden, Frank has $9,000 to spend, you still have your $10,000 and what started out as only $10,000 in the money supply has magically increased to $19,000

Before Frank spends it, the $9,000 loan he got goes directly into his bank account

When you think of tech on YouTube, the first name that probably pops up is Marques Brownlee, or MKBHD

So how did he get to this point where he’s getting around a million views a day and is one of the most influential youtuber voices in the space?

That’s what we’re here to find out in today’s analysis of Marques Brownlee - how did he get here, why's he's crushing the YouTube Algorithm and what can you take away from it?

he’s creeping up to 10 million subscribers

if we estimate extremely conservatively, he’s probably making at least $1,000 a day from YouTube ads alone, or $365,000 per year

This is also not including how much he makes through affiliate links, sponsorship deals, and selling his own merch

To see how it started, we have to take a trip back to the year 2005, this little known website called YouTube was created

Up until then, nobody really realized that YouTube would soon explode into a platform where people could make a full time living creating content

And in New Jersey, a little 13 year old by the name of Marques just got a new HP laptop, probably from Christmas and decided to record a review of the little media remote that came with it
Little did he know that this very video would lead to him running one of the most respected YouTube channels on the platform.

he rode the wave of YouTube and gained what’s called the First-Movers Advantage

Whether we look at the wave of venture capitalist investors throwing every dollar they had into tech companies during the DotCom bubble
Or the wave of real estate since the Great Recession [Big Short seminar]
Or the introduction of Apple’s app store or Facebook’s apps and the thousands of millionaires that were minted overnight…
Riding the waves of change makes everything in business easier

Riding a wave is great and all, but just because you’re one of the first mover’s, it doesn’t guarantee your success

sometimes the answer is just simple as this dude is super obsessed about tech

If you were in his shoes, it would be pretty tempting to just sit back and enjoy that sweet YouTube money.

The man has everything and all he’s concerned about, the only thing that keeps him up at night, is how to make his YouTube videos even more realistic

it takes what’s called being naturally inclined

Because if you’re not naturally inclined towards what you’re doing,  you’re not gonna last 10+ years

Nearly every single damn video that Graham Stephan has posted in the last 5 months have well over 100k views

nearly all of his videos on his second channel, The Graham Stephan Show, not even his main focus, has over 100k views.

#grahamstephan

And when you see that “bigger” names in the space like Grant Cardone, Valuetainment, Gary Vaynerchuck who have dedicated staffs of camera men, video editors, entire production teams with more subscribers than Graham can barely crack 50k views on their videos

You have to wonder, What is Graham Stephan doing differently?

There’s this myth that to succeed on YouTube you need to post as much as you can, the more content the better

It's a big fat lie

One of the biggest differences between Graham is that Graham only posts 3 times vs 7

Yet, with less videos, more engagement, more youtube video views, more loyal fans that just keep coming back again and again, faster growth

Why? Scarcity

You’re scrolling through YouTube, you see just another video from Gary Vee.

The video sounds like it’s probably pretty interesting, but you know that if you don’t watch this one, there’s gonna be another one 

But then you come across a video from Kurzgesagt, AKA In a Nutshell, and you know that they only posts twice a month

They’ve built so much trust, with you that the moment you see a new video from them, you instantly click and watch all the way through

This is the same thing with Graham Stephan.

You can tell that he’s making videos for the sake of making great, engaging videos just for his audience

When you see a video from him in your newsfeed, you know that if you don’t watch it, there’s not gonna be another one tomorrow

Authenticity 

We all want the lambos, the private jets, the mansions, and it’s cool to see people parading those things around on YouTube.

But what’s more relatable? Some guy with his own private jet or penthouse and Bentley?

And we see this to be true with so many other amazing channels out there

Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell: 9.2 million subs, posts 2 times a month

3Blue1Brown: 2m subs, posts 3-4 times a month

ColdFusion: 1.8m subs, posts once a week

Domain of Science, Learn Engineering, The Closer Look, Vsause, and countless. of other. examples.

LEMMiNO: 3.2 million subs, but get this, posts one video, every 2, to 3, months

Remarkable - Purple Cow

I think this lesson I learned from Seth Godin’s book, Purple Cow

What was remarkable yesterday, is only average today, and mediocre tomorrow.

There were other channels in the same topic as him, but what made his channel remarkable compared to other ones is that he was one of the first to have this authenticity and transparency and humor

Nearly every single damn video that Graham Stephan has posted in the last 5 months have well over 100k views

nearly all of his videos on his second channel, The Graham Stephan Show, not even his main focus, has over 100k views.

#grahamstephan

And when you see that “bigger” names in the space like Grant Cardone, Valuetainment, Gary Vaynerchuck who have dedicated staffs of camera men, video editors, entire production teams with more subscribers than Graham can barely crack 50k views on their videos

You have to wonder, What is Graham Stephan doing differently?

There’s this myth that to succeed on YouTube you need to post as much as you can, the more content the better

It's a big fat lie

One of the biggest differences between Graham is that Graham only posts 3 times vs 7

Yet, with less videos, more engagement, more youtube video views, more loyal fans that just keep coming back again and again, faster growth

Why? Scarcity

You’re scrolling through YouTube, you see just another video from Gary Vee.

The video sounds like it’s probably pretty interesting, but you know that if you don’t watch this one, there’s gonna be another one 

But then you come across a video from Kurzgesagt, AKA In a Nutshell, and you know that they only posts twice a month

They’ve built so much trust, with you that the moment you see a new video from them, you instantly click and watch all the way through

This is the same thing with Graham Stephan.

You can tell that he’s making videos for the sake of making great, engaging videos just for his audience

When you see a video from him in your newsfeed, you know that if you don’t watch it, there’s not gonna be another one tomorrow

Authenticity 

We all want the lambos, the private jets, the mansions, and it’s cool to see people parading those things around on YouTube.

You’ve probably seen a ton of ads for starting a social media marketing agency before.

Maybe you even sat through a webinar or two for these digital marketing courses and you’re on the edge.

I was one of them. And so was my business partner.

We were just drooling over the idea of just landing a few clients pay us a ridiculous retainer every month for running what seemed to be a few simple Facebook Ads

And we went all in - we had appointment setters cold calling small businesses, we had a dedicated white label fulfilling the online marketing for these clients, we bought multiple social media marketing courses, etc.

But after months of failure, we decided to throw in the towel and close the doors.

When SMMA started to become popular back in 2014/2015, it was a good opportunity

Business owners were completely new to marketing on social platforms so it was easy for agency owners to get their foot in the door and land clients whether you were good at it or not

But there lies the problem, because if you think about yourself, you’re probably interested in doing this to make money, not because you’re passionate about running Facebook Ads for the rest of your life.

So what happens? 

You have people trying to take 13k from business owners and then don't deliver any results.

So what happens to all these business owners that fired the SMMA that they were working with?

They’re gonna be very angry with you, they feel like they’ve been scammed and they’re associate digital marketers with scammers.

THIS is the market you’d be getting yourself into.

All the business owners that you’d be targeting have been screwed

You actually need to be really good at the social media ads you’ll be running, which is pretty hard

Marketing, advertising, and writing the sales copy for the ads themselves is a completely separate skill to master or at least get adequate at if you want to actually get these business owners results.

So there’s really high competition and the lowest demand, digital marketers have a horrible rep with business owners, and you have to learn way too many skills at once to be successful. So that begs the question: why are their so many ads for these courses?

The answer? It’s an easy pitch to sell you a course.

So do I recommend you start a social media marketing agency, a Facebook ads agency, or whatever?... No. Absolutely not.
