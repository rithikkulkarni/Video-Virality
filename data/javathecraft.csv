I tend to die in quite stupid ways, but I'm always up for a challenge.

In this world, the goal is not 100 days, or 1000 days, but rather to have it last forever. There are so many farms and different styles of architecture I'd love to try building,  so let's just hope I don't do anything dumb...

In this Episode, I decided that we needed to build a gunpowder farm. However, I didn't just want one piece of glass floating in the sky as my AFK platform while I waited for creepers to spawn. So I instead placed almost 12,000 glass blocks... But of course, this was not the only project we tackled today.

In this Episode, we set out to build a Japanese Village on top of a mountain, in hopes of having a place to put all of our villagers. However in order to do this, we first set out to take down the ender dragon, with the goal of collecting some shulker boxes. The journey to get to that point was... not the safest.

It's been way too long since the last video on this channel, and I was shocked to see I started recording this video over a year ago. But we are back and I am so happy with the end result.

In this Episode, we built a slime farm, and more importantly an entire ISLAND for our custom nether portal. This island was VERY heavily inspired by Genshin Impact's Spiral Abyss. I've never attempted to build custom terrain from scratch, so this was quite the learning experience for me.

In this episode, we sought out to build up our infrastructure. This meant getting an iron farm set up, and also making a villager breeder (with a nice-looking Japanese Ryokan to house it). Then just for fun, we made the iron from the iron farm defy gravity and shoot out of a well on the surface... Because why not?
